Sure, but people aren't upset that he's given a new account and a reason for the previous accounts being odd... people are upset that the new account doesn't explain why he made himself MORE involved in the previous accounts. newlinechar EDIT: To be clearer, his stated reasons for the earlier stories being false may make sense but why did he OVERSTATE his involvement if the truth is as he explained in the new interview? That makes no sense to me... unless he was helping the police bulk up their case against Adnan... which is, in and of itself, problematic.

Dave Reisner initially packages systemd for archlinux and back in the early days it was a lot of work to run. You had to write all your own units, etc. I remember the first time I tried to switch to systemd and after that whole ordeal my system wouldn't shutdown correctly... it was in the background for archlinux for a while. newlinechar  newlinechar What happened was two-fold: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. rc.conf was showing cracks. It used to configure everything but slowly things started leaving it. Stuff like `/etc/modprobe.d` or `/etc/module-load.d` landed which provided a better interface than the rc.conf file. Networking started getting too complicated to stick entirely in rc.conf so netcfg was made. But netcfg then ment code duplication with rc.conf. Backgrounding processes in rc.conf was a hack at best, etc, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. The developers, one by one, started going out of their way to use systemd over initscripts. The systemd switchover came when they realized they had no one testing the initscripts anymore. And no-one competent steped up. newlinechar  newlinechar Archlinux, for better or worse, revolves around the whims of the dev team. It is their baby and they make it suit themselves. With the mindshare shifted to systemd, it only made sense to transistion to it for ease of maintinance.

It's a nice knife. Funny someone would make such a decent fake when they could clearly make an original design with similar quality. The only thing really wrong with it is the pivot needs to be loktited, otherwise it gets really loose rather quickly. Once it's good and tight thought, it flips like a dream. I've owned a good number of flippers and this guy is up with the best of them. The anodizing looks great. clip is a decent balance between easy in/out without chewing up your pants. The blade centering on this one is immaculate. It feels good in my medium glove sized hands, nice and cozy, it'd be pretty hard for it to slip out of my hand. The end of the framelock where it meets the bottom of the blade has a steel bit screwed into place to prevent issues with the titanium. Besides the issue with the pivot, there's really no jimping anywhere except for the backspace, which is okay, this isn't really a tactical knife, but if jimping is your thing, there's not much to be had. I can't vouch for edge retention yet, as I've only ravaged some cardboard and paper, but so far it's held up just fine. Otherwise, this is something similar in fit and finish to a Benchmade from what I can tell. 
I don't want anything serious though. As long as you promise 0 emotional attachment.

I only feel modest in clothing that makes me look like a little girl.

I'm about to pop open some bubbly myself 
Most of the wood i have is fallen from black walnut trees. Altho i did cheat this time and started chopping apart small pieces of pallets but that didnt help a whole lot. I tried various stacking patterns. Started with a tinder bundle and then once it was lit began laying small twigs across the top tepee style. Also tried log cabin stacking with the small sticks.and twigs with a tinder bundle in the middle. The fire pit is maybe 2' across and 3'-4' deep. I had 4x4's around half of it but started pulling them away thinking that maybe they were stopping too much air.
Doh, maybe it is. I'm going on decade old memory here, that I learned in passing. You may very well be right.
Fair enough
There has been a shift in economics and I think its the main reason for the cry of 'where the good men are at?'.  As you have women surpassing men by a noticeable pace and women finding their dating pool ain't exactly great.  There has been a growing acceptence of stay at home fathers but its lagging to say the least due to men still being subject to being the bread winners.

I never said it was bad.

All Jews ignore certain parts of the Torah. The Torah has the death penalty for like every other thing. There are also an enormous number of supporting documents created by important cultural figures and theologians throughout the millennia. Different communities read different texts, interpret different things differently, or simply ignore other things. My suspicion having met many Jews, Christians,  and Muslims in my life is that the moderates don't even read their core texts. Extremists not only read core texts and supporting documents, but they also take traditions in their communities very seriously. Sexual segregation in ultra orthodox communities and face coverings in ultra conservative Muslim communities are examples of traditions, not so much specifically religiously mandated acts.

Maybe he's decided he doesn't give a fuck.

Right, which I think is really useful to know. But what I've seen happen is people read this and then forget what the cold hard reality is, you are dealing with another human being who hears these kinds of lines all day long, the safest thing you can do is be extremely polite, friendly, and cooperate until you're asked to do something that you're not comfortable with. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, I'm going to roll my window all the way down, I'll keep my hands in plain sight. I'm happy to provide my ID, and insurance, blah, blah, blah. If he asks me to step out of my car so he can search it, then the answers is a definite no unless he has a good reason. But hopefully it never gets to that point.  newlinechar  newlinechar I have quite a few friends who are cops. Good cops. But they get extremely irritated and some of the 'tips' in here and they've told me straight up that they will 'find' a reason to hold you longer for being an ass. Illegal? Maybe.

I think Judaism and Islam are far more similar than Christianity. Christianity took a big old 'left turn' when Paul took it to the Gentiles and its message became Hellenized (mixed with Greek/Roman 'stuff). That 'Trinity' bullshit isn't in Islam nor is Jesus though of as anything more than a prophet. But from what I've read you're absolutely right that early Christianity was around and had an impact on the formation of Islam.

Reaper is probably more flexible than anything for this kind of thing, but for different reasons. Ableton Live and Logic give you tools to get 'under the hood' and play with the routing. Reaper is technically more flexible because it open source. I'm sure some tech-wiz could write you some kind of script for a plugin that would do that in reaper, but reaper is hairier than anything else when it comes to that kind of stuff, and it's pretty intimidating for any daw. Ask around at /r/Reaper or the forums on Cockos' website, but I personally can't help, only point you in the right direction.

My assumption about Ward only goes as far as how I think the season will end. I believe it's very realistic that some time in the future Ward may be contacted by either Skye or Coulson to help with a supernatural threat, i.e. the Inhumans.

They have to utilize Ward for something, and it will involve Skye in some form or another.

Hm alright then. I'll change my comment to 'near-omnipotent beings' then. The only reason I used the term 'omnipotent' is because that's the term that's repeatedly used in the classic Dr. Strange comics I'm reading, to describe beings like Dormammu, Shuma-Gorath and Mephisto and etc (and only when they are inside their own realms are they considered omnipotent). But I guess that's just an exaggeration then.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Graphic Design University, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret branding ops for Fortune 500s, and I have over 300 confirmed logos.

But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit noise and grain all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
I totally get what you mean in terms of being cautious. There were a few times where I noticed that he put himself in between myself and others until we passed them. For example, we were walking through a parking lot back home (back in our old apartment in Queens), and there were about 5-6 guys standing in the middle talking with each other. He's on an extender leash so he was ahead of me, but I noticed him notice them ahead of us, slowed down until he was in between them and myself, and then when we passed them completely he sped up again. He didn't lunge or bark or do anything differently other than that though, it's only because I'm always paying attention to everything he does that I noticed it. Too bad he doesn't know what officer's uniforms look like, but again - I don't mind him being protective of me. :)

That brings up an interesting question. More likely than not, there are association footballers, track stars, people living in deserted African or Siberian villages who have the potential (numbers and intangibles) to start at some position in the NFL. newlinechar  newlinechar There are 32 starting NFL quarterbacks coming from a pool of 316.1 million. That means that in the US, there is one starting quarterback per  9,878,125 people. There are 7 billion people in the world, or 708 (rounding down) NFL starting caliber guys in the world. Subtract 32 (for those already on NFL rosters) and that's 676 who mathematically could start right now for a franchise. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We have to find just ONE of those guys before Sunday.

Except it's not about all Hasidics. Fucking read for Christ's sake. The post you responded to mentioned 'people who dress like that' and a specific sect, and you responded with a generalization about Jewish people, considering the post you responded to wasn't about any specific Hasidic section but merely mentioned one. You're so concerned about someone being treated unfairly aligning with your ideology that you're willing to shit on some other group. And I realize that certain Hasidic sects are backwards as hell and deserve criticism for their social policies, but that is almost irrelevant to what I said to you.
Each and every year millions of people wrongly use the term 'I could care less'. The phrase 'I could care less' has become a very common phrase used to express your lack of interest in an aforementioned topic. However, the phrase makes no sense. We, the people of the internet, must fix this! newlinechar  newlinechar Now, by using the phrase 'I could care less,' the point you are trying to make is, on a scale of 0 - 10, that you care absolutely 0. However, if you could care less, you cannot be at 0 caring, as there must be a level below that to care less. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, the correct phrase to express 0 caring is 'I couldn't care less.' If you could not care less, then you are Absolute 0 Caring. You CAN NOT care less than you currently do. Absolute Zero Caring. newlinechar  newlinechar **Summary:** newlinechar  newlinechar I could care less : **WRONG**  newlinechar  newlinechar I couldn't care less: **RIGHT** newlinechar  newlinechar [Duty Calls...](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png) newlinechar

Agreed, that's the point I'm trying to make.  If you say that power is a measure of loudness you have to agree that not only does a 60 dB wave have twice the *power* of a 57 dB wave, but that it's also twice as *loud*.  Of the three metric given (amplitude, power, or dB) decibels is the only one that really makes any sense for a logarithmically perceived quantity. newlinechar  newlinechar This is also true for light, although light is always measures using linear metrics (lux, candelas) it is perceived logarithmically, so 200 lx doesn't look twice as 'bright' as 100 lx. newlinechar  newlinechar Side note- This is why I hate words like 'loud' and 'bright' in technical contexts.

It's literally semantics. :D Synonyms are useless unless they have a slight distinction, after all. But yeah, before accepting a gift the social implications should always be considered.

If they bring you food, you should return the dish with food in it (or a separate dish of food, continuing the cycle!). These things are important! newlinechar  newlinechar The ex is definitely a douche. Leaving someone after that long and so much mutual dependence with so little warning or planning is pretty much unforgivable.

For the same reason she somewhat pities Angel when Tina casts her as a horrendous spider monster that wanted to kill everyone - Claptrap didn't have a choice in the matter. His programming bound him to follow Jack. Installing and uninstalling the VaultHunter.exe protocols, according to Claptrap's origin ECHOs, also screws with Claptrap's memory, so it's possible Clappy doesn't remember even being the Fragtrap. Her whole purpose in interrogating Athena is to see if she feels sorry for what she did. Instead, Athena makes no apologies for the role she played, and that understandably pisses Lilith off. Had she run Claptrap through that same line of questioning, it's unclear if he even would have remembered, so it would've been little more than an exercise in futility. newlinechar  newlinechar Unlike Claptrap and Angel, Athena had the option to walk away at any time.

That's an interesting point. Clearly the economic dimension is huge. And if you take France, Gaullism in the 1960's had a definite ethnic tinge. The best way I can think of is to track the differences about Algeria: in the 1960's it was about hanging on to French Algeria, with the National Front it is all about how Algeria was also the good fight (Le Pen senior was a paratrooper).  newlinechar  newlinechar The thing is that a.) the National Front is now distancing itself from that position and b.) Gaullism was also in some vague contradictory sense anti-Fascist, or at least based on the mythology of the French resistance: but that's becoming weaker as well.  newlinechar  newlinechar So there's definitely a continuity of sentiments but the direction and motivation is changing.

It's funny, Chinese manufacturing operations have picked up on the fact that there's big money in unique and well made metal work.

Who hasn't killed an Avatar? newlinechar 
&gt; Sure they do. newlinechar  newlinechar No they aren't. Not even light works the same way. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It was virtual. Whatever was creating it created it from x point, and his hand contained the virtual gravity inside his hand because it wasn't real gravity. That said I don't know the context of that feat only that it exists. newlinechar  newlinechar If the gravity can't go trough physical things (like superman's hands) then why not just throw it on a box or a room? Zero fucking sense using our understanding of gravity, dude. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Easy. The pages don't exist in this world, but exist in a different dimension. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't understand what you're trying to say or imply with that.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Unless the magic becomes exponentially more costly. newlinechar  newlinechar What part of infinity aren't you getting? infinity minus X is still infinity no matter what number you put on X. The spell has to be an absolute that makes the weight be constant, not a thing that is more costly depending on how many times you use it as those would essentially be divisors, infinity divided by any finite amount is still infinity.  newlinechar  newlinechar Negating infinity isn't something that requires repetition because the point of infinity is that it never ends, stacking spells that reduce its weight a bunch of times would essentially be useless because infinity minus anything but infinity is still infinity. If they used infinity then the book had no business being so heavy for Superman to struggle with it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Think of it like file compression. You can compress a 10 gig file into say 1 gig, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it smaller. newlinechar  newlinechar I know that is what you were trying to say, but you can't compress an infinite file, reduce it by 1/5 of its size and it would be still the same. The logic you're applying only works with constants. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They can make magic compress infinite weight into a 'manageable' weight, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it less weight. newlinechar  newlinechar Zero fucking sense. For the concept of infinite 0.00000001 is indistinguishable from 10^99^99^99^99. If you managed to make something infinite weight less than infinite, it would be a piece of cake to reduce the weight of anything to almost nothing. Is not like you're worrying about losing data like in file compression, the data in this case is on the pages not on the weight. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, something you haven't used for an argument would be way more simple, maybe the person that casted the spell to make its weight constant, made it to weight as much as he could possibly lift, but I don't know who casted the spell on the book that you're saying it has.
Fair enough, your average trainer isn't going to be able to tame Rayquaza. However, you're not the average trainer. You're the trainer that saved the world from a disaster of biblical proportions at the age of 10 before even challenging the Pokemon league. Sure, something like Arceus is a bit far-fetched, but a legendary bird or golem? Maybe a Darkrai or Cresselia? These rare Pokemon are steeped in legend but it's not totally unreasonable for a master Pokemon trainer to possess one of them. newlinechar  newlinechar That's how I justify using Latias, anyway. She's one of my all time favorites and there's no way I'm going to box her just because she's canonically legendary.

I don't believe we do. Child support is designed to make sure a child can be taken care of. So long as giving the child a proper chance at life is an option (which it is through adoption in the US), why would we need to make up for lack of child support? newlinechar  newlinechar Bringing a child into the world is a financial decision. If a woman choses to bring a child into this world knowing she will have no financial help and happens to fail to provide proper support for the child (whether she knew she would not be able to or she simply falls down on her luck), why should she not be punished for it? If you try and buy a house but fall short on payment, the reason behind your lack of payments doesn't change that fact that the house gets taken away. Why would a child be different? No matter the reason, if you are unable to support a child (and need to rely on a secondary funding source to do so), why should there not be consequence for taking the money?

Eh, I disagree. newlinechar  newlinechar It has a lot more to do with strong structure than it does engineering. OP is using a pretty unique example (a multi-part rock opera) versus two modern pop songs. newlinechar  newlinechar You could easily find many, many, many songs from Queen's era that work with this site (search isn't working for me so unfortunately I can't give it a go). Conversely, you could easily find many, many, many songs from the last ten years that don't work at all with the site. newlinechar  newlinechar OP is cherry-picking to make some stupid, played-out 'DAE think modern music sucks compared to le Queen' argument. newlinechar  newlinechar Really, if the final point is 'oh engineering got better' then... OK? Of course it did... I'm not sure how that simple fact 'says a LOT about music in general'. newlinechar

&gt; Really most clothing that's not loose and untailored looks immodest to me newlinechar  newlinechar I'm guessing that you're doing fine and that your *perception* is a bit out of whack (and I have to guess, we're on the internet not in person).  That's not a criticism, as you're trying to do the right thing in being modest.  That's a good thing.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I often feel like I have the wrong sort of body for modesty newlinechar  newlinechar Nope.  You have your body, given to you by God.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I feel like a lot of guys see a large-chested woman, they see her as immodest newlinechar  newlinechar That's on them, *not you*.  That is 100% out of your control and 100% not your responsibility.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Brothers and sisters, what am I missing? newlinechar  newlinechar Perspective, probably.  Do you have any Catholic women that you can talk to in person about this issue?  Perhaps talking to your priest would also help. newlinechar  newlinechar --------------------- newlinechar  newlinechar You can also look into classic clothing.  Those outfit basics that don't go out of style.  Right now if I were a woman I'd probably not be seen outside without a cable knit sweater and jeans (we guys have it so much easier in this area).  100% coverage, 100% comfy.  Button up blouses go pretty much year round.  So do slacks.  Swap out your accessories and you can somewhat keep up with fashion so you don't look 'young' or dated. newlinechar  newlinechar There are cool places out there (Edit: PM for a specific recommendation, didn't think about the rules for a sec) that not only offer some cool current and retro dresses and separates, but they also tailor it to your dimensions for a reasonable fee.  My wife loves these dresses--modest and cute as well as retro.  She has ordered me to tell you that you should never pay full price on such sites, as there are always coupons.   newlinechar  newlinechar Basically, in my opinion if you're trying you're probably doing fine.  I would highly suggest talking to someone you know if you have anyone you'd trust.

There's no such thing as preemptively abdicating, so I assume you're joking. newlinechar  newlinechar But there are people who think that Charles should basically decide not to become King in order to let William become King. Either by refusing the crown or abdicating like his great-uncle did. I just seriously doubt that's going to happen. Charles has lived his entire life expecting to become King one day. Don't think he's going to give it up. It's not like him accepting the crown means William won't become King. Obviously, William should out-live Charles and will eventually become King. newlinechar  newlinechar Gotta feel a little sorry for the second sons (Andrew and Harry). The pro is that they get to live like a royal, but with none of the responsibility or spotlight of being the first born. The con is that you live your entire life knowing that your only purpose is to be a spare just in case your brother dies before having kids. Then, once he has kids, you are truly superfluous. Andrew went from having like a 10% chance of one day becoming king to having approximately 0% chance on the day that William was born.

If you go to the main menu of your X or Y game, select 'Mystery Gift.' Then, select 'Receive Gift'  and then choose the last option 'Get with Code.' Then you should be able to redeem your Diancie! It only works on X and Y cartridges, though, not the new Ruby and Sapphire games. Good luck! :)

With each charge cycle, the batteries wear increasing the internal resistance of the cell just a bit. Marrying a pair of batteries so that they wear evenly over time ensures that you don't have one more worn than the other, which if you're lucky will shorten the cell's lifespan and could lead to venting because one is working harder to keep up with the other. It's also a good idea in a serial setup (like the hexohm v2) to switch the batteries in the sled each cycle (a on left one cycle, on right the next) although this is less important than having a married pair (depending on who you ask). 
Right. But if the marbles instead go down in value, say to 50 cents for 100 marbles, you've lost 50% of your cash value. Bitcoin is extremely volatile, it may be significantly more valuable or significantly less valuable or exactly as valuable compared to when you bought it. The reason for this is as the Bitcoin ecosystem grows speculators are trying to guess how much each bitcoin is worth and going to be worth, and those guesses change dramatically each week.

Ehhhh. A little bit of the manifesto and what other commies have rehashed to me. It has helped with understanding economics a little better, but that just made me lean towards syndicalism. Sure capitalism allows for people to get lucky and never have to do anything productive for the rest of their lives, but socialism has this miserable taboo that is so embedded in some cultures we may as well give up trying to preach it. Syndicates have been shown to work the most effectively for the most people in real life. But there's still thus competitive atmosphere that I see is necessary, but it's not exactly morally fulfilling. I think it's more a problem with people thah politics.

Sorry, I didn't see anything about actually using the skills to learn in your original post so I assumed you were talking about just reading material. newlinechar  newlinechar Perhaps it would help if you described the concepts you are having trouble with? People in this subreddit seem pretty willing to help! I'm sure you aren't too stupid, Haskell is just radically different from imperative languages.

It's also very easy to learn Ruby/Lua/&lt;insert imperative language here&gt; if you already know Python, etc. Haskell has some pretty new concepts *and* you have to unlearn quite a bit of what you already know about programming.

&gt; I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again. It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, even then, if there was a spin off and he appeared even once to be the villain that would be his 4th attempt already on OUAT's timeline and that is just ridiculous. His last plot was just soo nonsensical...But oh well,before anything is to hope the spin off happens on the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I didn't get that at all. I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc. newlinechar  newlinechar Mmm, well I went back to the OUAT fandom giving that the season was over and there was no more spoilers, and at least on the places I hang out, the Frozen arc was actually liked by a majority. Seems the dislike for it faded away as the story progressed, and on the threads about them, Elsa really seemed like the favored one because she fitted more on the style of the show. They did like Anna a lot tough, and her romance with Kristoff, it was just that they preferred Elsa. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon. The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah , it was good that Disney made the AU non-canonical when they bought SW.

I'm not a structural engineer, so I can't give you generalisable answers. You can see before the reno the load bearing beam was below the joists in the opening that existed between these two rooms - probably because it was cheaper and easier to install in this configuration.  newlinechar  newlinechar No, you sacrifice no strength - the joist span is identical in both cases. As long as the ends of the beam are properly supported, and the beam is appropriately dimensioned and compositioned for this job (OP used an LVL beam), everything is the same as if there was a studded wall there.  newlinechar  newlinechar This may not be possible with a second story. The height of the beam is what gives it its strength. There may not be space between stories to install an appropriate beam for the span. Using a steal I-beam can often work. Also, both ends need to be supported with their own footing. OP's house is build on-slab, so its this isn't really an issue.

When an enemy is running across my screen, it is far easier to hit and kill them on 128 tick. Movement on my end feels noticeably different too. Hitting 2-3 bunny hops on 128 tick is a cakewalk. Stringing hops together on 64 tick is all about luck.

You can snip all you want, but it's a historical fact that most of the natural wealth of Siberia and the Russian Far East was not exploitable, sometimes until after the World War II era. Comparing development in California or across the middle of the American continent to development in Siberia is just not a valid comparison. It really isn't.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm also not talking about stuff that meets the technical definition of arable land. Kansas isn't fucking Siberia. It's ridiculous to compare the two and you know it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes I do, and given some of America's potential competitors having been hamstrung by weird internal issues, it isn't exactly notable that the United States ended up on the winning of that. Free trade doesn't have anything to do with this. They were completely free to trade. They fought wars to force the Chinese government into rescinding limitations and protectionism against foreign trade, and made China completely open to (unwanted) Western business, while all the Western nations had policies to build their own industries at the disadvantage of their competitors.  newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that they continue to be unable or unwilling to do much with it in the 21st century bodes poorly for the hypothesis that they could or should have done something differently with it in the 1800's.  newlinechar  newlinechar They didn't choose anything. Societies don't make two or three-way choices at pivotal moments. History isn't actually like EU4 or something.

Crowding the referee is more common in football than other sports because a single decision can completely change the game. Things like red cards and penalties can easily decide the match. There's also no challenge system like in other sports, so decisions don't simply get reversed. It can also affect later decisions in the same match if the referee feels pressured to maybe even something out.

'Now it’s clear that hyperglycemia (HG) alone or combined with hypercholesterolemia has synergistic toxic effects on the survival and function of stem cells' - Why is this important? Because stem cells are established to be reparative to vessels, which prevents arteriosclerosis (Yes, you know this - the one that causes CHD, IHD, sudden heart attacks, decreased blood flow, etc.). newlinechar  newlinechar But what if it is the hypercholesterolemia that causes the toxic effects on stem cells? 'Increased dietary carbohydrates, particularly simple sugars and starches with high glycemic index, can increase levels of small, dense LDL and HDL'. Even then, carbohydrates increase the rates of LDL, which we all know as a major factor in the production of cardiovascular diseases and arteriosclerosis. newlinechar  newlinechar There is no surprise that a diet low in simple sugars (besides fructose) and meat has been proven to be most healthy. That is the way our body has developed for tens of thousands of years of evolution.  newlinechar  newlinechar In order for a study to be done on low-carb diets accurately, it must either measure the effects of a diet where most of the protein comes from vegetable sources, or one where most come from animal sources. In this study, (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19506174), 'reductions in LDL-C concentration and total cholesterol-HDL-C and apolipoprotein B-apolipoprotein AI ratios were greater for the low-carbohydrate compared with the high-carbohydrate diet'. In this case, the low-carb diet got its protein from vegetable sources, a diet recognized to be very natural for our body. Most of the hate from 'clean' diets comes from the fact that not all low-carb diets actually do what they claim. We know that 'Low-carbohydrate, high-animal protein diets, which are advocated for weight loss, may not promote the desired reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration', but that is just indicative of the well-known fact that animal protein is not very healthy for us, most significantly when consume in excess. newlinechar  newlinechar Bottom line - eating healthy means eating less (something I didn't touch on, but is very important), and and eating a low-carb diet that is low on meat. These types of diets have been shown to decrease chances of diseases ranging from cardiovascular disease to cancer to diabetes. But let's face it - bodybuilders right now are concerned with IIFYM, not longeivity :) newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3475066/ newlinechar http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16256003

My nose used to be a lot worse actually. I broke my nose when I was young, and had a huge bump until I was 16. That's when I got surgery for a deviated septum and got the bump removed. My parents and the doctors understood that I wasn't doing it to fit in or because of bullying, just because I wanted it done for myself to improve my image. I've always thought about getting surgery again when I'm older because I'm still not pleased with the shape. newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks so much!

My husband decided to become a reverend, and as a result is going to school full time. Combine that with a poor-ish childhood and you create a person like me: frugal and concerned with saving money.  newlinechar  newlinechar There were some extremely lean years, and I started working at 15. I have put myself in situations that were less than safe due to lack of funds and no choice (buses and CTA through bad neighborhoods, broken down car in bad areas, putting up with sexual harassment at work because I needed the money, etc) and after having a kid, I realized I never wanted her in those situations.  newlinechar  newlinechar I get my inspiration from Mormon housewife blogs and Pinterest, mostly. I know Mormons are not well-liked on the internet, but those ladies have to present themselves In a certain way, have a bunch of kids (typically), can't really work outside the home, and need to make a dollar stretch. They give some darn good tips. (I should add that we are not Mormon, but still, the money saving tips are great!)  newlinechar  newlinechar I remind myself that any dollar I don't need to spend is a dollar my kid doesn't need to earn later in life. That stops me from spending money I don't need to spend.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We are in the process of moving now, from a really expensive extremely rich neighborhood, to a middle class one. We will be selling our condo, and for half the price, buying a two bedroom home. I make a good living, but at work, I'm the person who is always willing to help,  always willing to go the extra mile, and as a result, in a position to say 'I saved company $13m in 2013, can I have a 10% raise?' When you put it that way, and can verify it, they have a hard time saying no.  newlinechar  newlinechar I work as a female in a male dominated industry (like 99.8% male) and therefore NO ONE NOTICES WHAT I WEAR. Hence the capsule wardrobe.  newlinechar  newlinechar Another blog I read for inspiration is olgasflavorfactory.com. She has lessons from her immigrant parents on there. It's worth it's weight in gold.  newlinechar  newlinechar Tl;dr:  a poor childhood stays with you forever. 
Even putting aside this point, it's perfectly legal to show **pretty much anything in a movie**, since it's something that a studio can decide to release or not release, a theater can choose to exhibit or not exhibit, and a movie goer can decide to go see or not see.  newlinechar  newlinechar Broadcast television is a limited public space (there is only so much broadcast bandwidth available), and so it was decided that broadcasts in this public space should be subject to public regulation (the Federal Communication Commission). That's why you can't show boobies on broadcast TV, that's why you can't say 'God cunt-fucking dammit' on broadcast TV and that's why you can't show someone's head exploding on broadcast TV.

&gt;So this was intended as a bit of a trap newlinechar  newlinechar Well [of course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F4qzPbcFiA)  Isn't that the whole idea? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If animals are ~30% as mentally capable as humans should we eat, cage, etc them? newlinechar  newlinechar Definitely. Though I'd put it at closer to 1%.  I'd also consider it a 'threshold' situation and not a linear one, so an animal with 30% of our intelligence doesn't deserve 30% of our moral consideration; it deserves 0% until it deserves 100%. And IMO the only reasonable line for that cut-off is: they're smart enough to meaningfully participate in the Social Contract. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Would you do that to a mentally handicapped person  newlinechar  newlinechar That's an interesting case to consider. Historically the argument has been made both ways. Personally, I consider this pragmatically: it's just not practical to have our moral/legal duties depend on qualities that are not superficially evident (imagine arguing with a cop that the person you just shot had an IQ of 59 and not 60 and therefore wasn't a person). The only unambiguous 'bright line' is human/animal. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;how do you feel about utilitarianism newlinechar  newlinechar I like the fact that utilitarians value ends over means. I dislike the fact that they quibble about nonsense like 'well-being' or 'happiness'. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;don't you feel that in some way by being a vegan/vegetarian with the world in its current state that one is helping out newlinechar  newlinechar Abso-fucking-lutely not. See my point about population control. I really believe that. I also believe that people a) are incapable of individually affecting the behavior of markets and b) even if they could, it would distort the price-signals that markets provide, ultimately resulting in a suboptimal misallocation of resources.

Before Mad Cow was clearly identified the Cows in pastures would go crazy essentially and stop being able to function, they'd find a dead cow and take it to the meal grinder (thinking nothing of it) then a few more cows would die, they'd do the same thing.

Saying that we can't rule something out 'just because there is no evidence' is illogical. That is what the entire judicial system is built upon: evidence. Sometimes it's hard DNA evidence, sometimes it's circumstantial evidence, but *some kind* of evidence is the starting point. There has never been any credible motive given for Jay killing Hae, nevermind a mystery third person, so how you can see that as just as plausible as Adnan being involved (with all the circumstantial evidence I presented to you) is beyond me.... newlinechar  newlinechar You are correct that one person saying it doesn't make it so, which is why I mentioned the students and police officer who testified he asked Hae for a ride, and why I mentioned the Leakin Park pings that contradicts Adnan's assertion he was at the mosque, and the Nisha Call, which Nisha confirms, and the note that says 'I am going to kill.'  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't understand how you or anyone can shrug off all of the things I presented as a lack of evidence... They are all strong pieces of circumstantial evidence, and when viewed all together there is no other plausible explanation other than Adnan's guilt. newlinechar  newlinechar

Currently watching a TV series called *Treme* which is *excellent*. newlinechar  newlinechar Honestly, it's a great show!  Not in my 'favourite' shows list, but it's definitely a show that I'd recommend. newlinechar  newlinechar It was created by David Simon (who also created *The Wire*) and, like any of his shows, you need to invest a few episodes in before you start to give a fuck for the characters, but once you do, you get hooked, y'know? newlinechar  newlinechar It's set in a district of New Orleans called Treme a year or two after Hurricane Katrina (each series is later, as time progresses).  And it focuses on topics from police corruption to politics to the FBI to the native bands, festivals, businesses, and just culture of the area, if that makes sense? newlinechar  newlinechar Honestly, it's quite beautiful yet engaging at the same time. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, massive focus on music!  Each 60 minute episode features around 10 minutes of music either through live performances (a few characters are musicians) or just the music that comes on in normal shows.  You can YouTube a playlist of music from the show but it's a big focus on blues, soul and old-school R&amp;B (which I love!) newlinechar  newlinechar I could go on about other shows or films, but I'll take the whole bloody night knowing me. newlinechar  newlinechar What show(s) are you currently watching yerself, stranger?

In its usual form, it estimates how many trials an attacker who does not have direct access to the password would need, on average, to guess it correctly. The strength of a password is a function of length, complexity, and unpredictability.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Using strong passwords lowers overall [risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk) of a security breach, but strong passwords do not replace the need for other effective [security controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_controls).

The first factor is the main focus in this article. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The rate at which an attacker can submit guessed passwords to the system is a key factor in determining system security. Some systems impose a time-out of several seconds after a small number (e.g. three) of failed password entry attempts.

I'm not sure I agree that there isn't proof.  You can see that the person is approaching the road.  You have testimony of the person whose car was damaged.  The damage to the car can be shown.  There may have even been a shoe print remaining or some similar physical evidence.  The sound indicates something hit the car.  The video shows the person is there and correlates his presence to the side of the damaged car and the sound.   newlinechar  newlinechar The question is whether it's more likely the car was damage beforehand AND this person did not hit the car or (in my mind most likely) that the person did in fact damage the car as claimed.  If the officer followed up diligently there could potentially be evidence from that as well.  I would imagine if this went to a trial, there is a reasonable chance of winning.

This is a weird meme that has gotten traction in some political circles. No, there was some token assistance from the Chinese, but the Chinese were not huge fans of the Vietnamese. They were not on good terms, as shown by the fact that China invaded Vietnam shortly after the end of the War (in the ironically named Self-Defensive Counteroffensive). The soviets were not on much better terms, and between their lack of interest on the one hand and their inability to project geopolitical power outside their near-abroad on the other, they didn't do much.

It is a square pizza similar to [Sicilian-style pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_pizza) that has a thick deep-dish crisp crust and toppings such as [pepperoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepperoni) and olives, and is served with the marinara sauce on top.   The square shaped pizza is the result of being baked in a square pan, which is often not a pizza pan.  Rather, industrial parts trays are often used, which were originally made to hold small parts in factories.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The crust of a Detroit-style pizza is noteworthy because in addition to occasionally being twice-baked, it is usually baked in a well-oiled pan to a chewy medium-well-done state that gives the bottom and edges of the crust a fried/crunchy texture.

The resulting pizza has a warm, chewy texture that, when combined with the sauce and toppings, is intensely flavorsome. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;==== newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/tQMrGev.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Buddyssmallpizza.jpg) newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar ^Interesting: [^Jet's ^Pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet%27s_Pizza) ^| [^Quad ^City-style ^pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad_City-style_pizza) ^| [^Pizza ^cutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_cutter) ^| [^Pizza ^pugliese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_pugliese)  newlinechar  newlinechar ^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&amp;message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cnatbal) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&amp;subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&amp;message=%2Bdelete+cnatbal)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)

The numbers located along the green lines connecting the stars are an indication of distance in light years between them. The maximum distance the connections are displayed is 10.0 light years, which is a convention for hyperspace travel.  newlinechar  newlinechar Since a vessel even with the best of calculations will drift due to gravitational forces, the usual maximum range for a safe hyperspace jump is 10 light years. After this point a vessel must return to normal space, recalibrate the hyperdrive, recharge the capacitors, and calculate a new course to continue to a farther destination. Remaining in hyperspace beyond the 10 light year limit can divert a vessel dangerously off course, in addition to the strain of hyperspace upon the drives resulting in malfunctions which render them inoperable. For this reason most hyperspace travel is conducted directly between star systems, using them as waypoints to reach farther targets while stopping to refuel and resupply. Fleets often arrive dispersed over several hundreds of kilometers from gravitational effects, as each ship jumps individually. newlinechar  newlinechar Thus the green lines of distance are also an indication of the routes that hyperdrive vessels take when travelling.

True, Morey would ship DMo out for Anderson no doubt just based on skill, Houston already has the defense so Anderson would be a perfect fit... but for the 8.5 mil he is making compared to DMo's 2.5, I don't know. If DMo expects to be paid after his contract is up next year though, I bet he does it. But if you can have DMo for half the price, I think you stick with that no? And you have to consider how DMo is part of the reason that defense is so solid.

That's why MVP should be removed then. What's the point, everyone knows QBs are the most valuable position, it's a bit redundant to have an award that says Most Valuable Player when in reality that means it can only go to a QB almost every time. Peyton MVP of his team? Well no fucking shit, he's the QB. Ryan Tannehill is the MVP of his team but that doesn't mean he was mind blowingly good, it just means he is the QB. (I don't actually know shit about the Dolphins because I don't care about them but I'm just guessing based on the limited roster knowledge I have of their team) MVP is basically 'Best QB' award, and really it's barely even that because Peyton was winning that shit regularly even when other QBs were putting up equal or better performances.

I do Ft. Worth more than Dallas, and really I'm from Arlington so I was more hoping to point you in the direction of things to do near the stadium unfortunately. I'd say that you if you're close to Ft. Worth, Ol South Pancake house for breakfast, and Velvet Taco for a fourth meal are good places to eat that aren't expensive at all since it sounds like you're getting gouged on prices everywhere else. Velvet Taco is also very near the bar scene and is open until 3 on weekends so you can hit it up with a nice buzz going no problem. Torchy's Tacos may be better, but they does not stay open as late. If you're into sushi, Blue Sushi is immaculate, but a bit pricey.  Hopefully we can get some Horned Frogs in this thread to give you some good BBQ places to go while you're here in Texas. I would also put in a personal recommendation for Kincaid's Burgers, the one on Camp Bowie. I know a lot of people have their own burger places in Ft. Worth, but Kincaid's is mine. newlinechar  newlinechar Near the stadium, BFF bar and grill if you like chinese, vietnamese, or japanese has like 50 beers on tap from mainly Texas Craft brewers. Then there's Grease Monkey, which is really good burgers and a decent beer selection with live music often. Babe's Chicken, the Arlington location is not the original, but is still a good style. Beware though, all they have is chicken and fried catfish with buffet style sides. Even closer to the stadium, and a good tip for parking, is Lincoln Square Shopping Center. Back in September they were still running a policy where you can spend $40 at any of their shops and park there during the game for free. You can look up a list of restaurants in the center [here.](http://www.lincolnsquarearlington.com/dine) newlinechar  newlinechar  If you want cheap beers on tap, and cheap bar food that isn't bad, No Frills Grill in Arlington on Little Road does 3.69 Pints of some of the best beer you can find in the city. They even carry DeSchutes on tap. It's a bit of dive, but the food and beer is as cheap as you can find for bar food. It's pretty far from the stadium though. There other locations do not have anywhere near the selection though on tap, so I can't speak for those. It's about 30 minutes from cowboys stadium though. newlinechar  newlinechar  I'll keep thinking, and report back, as there are a lot of things to do in DFW.

I realize how extremely dangerous this is. I could have ruptured the staple line. But that's what BED will do to you. I really needed help and am getting help. Also, psychologically  I'm finally adjusting to eating less food. So things are going a lot better. I'm also exercising every day. newlinechar  newlinechar My surgeon would like to see me at 170 pounds. At this point, I'd be grateful to get under 200. When I get to 170 I'll decide if I want to lose anymore. newlinechar  newlinechar My recovery after the surgery was very simple. I was up and walking around the first day. Since I'm still so heavy I still have a lot of joint and back pain and get tired easily. I'm sure that will improve as the weight continues to come off. newlinechar  newlinechar Give yourself time! My surgeon told me 1 pound a week was realistic. Also, you may not lose weight again for weeks. Give your body some time to adjust.  newlinechar  newlinechar The most important thing is to address the BED. If you are anything like me you will want to comfort eat and binge even after the surgery. Eventually, you will get hungry again and you're really going to have to fight the drive to overeat. Like I said, it's taken me nearly a year. This is the biggest psychological transition I have ever made in my life. Hell, I even messed up today when I ate a whole tuna sandwich. I felt like I was going to explode. I should have eaten half. It takes time to learn these lessons! newlinechar  newlinechar I wish you all the best with whatever you choose to do :)
They are. The current status is that it's in limited beta test. No idea how good it is... As far as I heard it's heavily cloud based.
I hate to be 'that guy' but the game simply cannot be balanced around low ranks. Think about it, how much of an issue was the CZ at your rank? When I played on my smurf it was never an issue, but anything above the AK ranks and it was completely absurd. People would switch from their M4 to their CZ to retake a site because of the 1-tap against helmets. If we balanced the game for Novas, it would never have been changed. Long bomb timers make rotating far too easy and honestly make the maps even more CT sided because they can really take their time with retakes. Also having any differences between the highest tier of matchmaking and the absolute lowest tier of these leagues is a bad thing. It's the same reason Valve stopped updating the '_se' maps, splitting up what the matchmaking community does and what pro player do make 'going pro' that much harder. 
I agree but injuries aside I believe a majority of that falls on poor coaching.

No, but the thought of queers stepping up and calling the shots on what queer liberation looks like is apparently threatening to you. We don't exist to make straight people comfortable. If you want us to package everything in a way that isn't uncomfortable to you, then consider the fact that just *existing* as a queer person is discomfort so great, many of us end our lives.

I last worked on the game about 3.5-4 years ago so I can't speak to what's been going on since, though I do know it is in pure maintenance mode - minimum staff, simply put out content and sustain itself. newlinechar  newlinechar Before that point, we on the team always wanted to put in game rune management in and it was being worked on at several points.  However, a lot of our resources were redirected into other projects such as some really ill-advised facebook games and integration with SOE's game launcher portal so it never completed, and the closing of our studio put an end to that.  The tutorial and new user experience was another area we were always trying to improve, but the will from management simply wasn't there to fund it after the first pass (the full game revamp of UI/simplification of mechanics done in 2009-2010 which included a new tutorial and new starter decks) failed to produce any improvements in our numbers.  Resolutions were a tricky spot - the initial engine for the game, as you might imagine for a game made in java by a mobile game company in the early 2000s, was not very easy to work with.  It was harder to fix than it looked according to our engineers, and there was never any real impetus from leadership to get it done. newlinechar  newlinechar Really the story of Poxnora is defined by the poor return on the marketing spend by SOE.  A lot of money was spent on advertising in really questionable places early on after the acquisition (such as sports and news websites), and after that failed the confidence of management in the game just slowly decayed away.  Generally developers are aware of the problems with their game (I was a hardcore player and addict of Poxnora for 2 years before I worked on it, and was always involved in the community) but unfortunately they don't always get to make the decisions.

To elaborate on this a little bit, natural movement is very complex. Eg. if you reach out to grab something you don't just tilt your shoulder and stretch your elbow, there is also some movement in the upper torso. And we are talking about some extremely simple action now. newlinechar  newlinechar Think about interacting actions (raise to the tips of your toes and stretch your arm to reach something), or worst of all facial expressions. And then those actions all have to fit together to produce an image that your brain wont instantly reject as robotic or fake (your brain is super good at that). newlinechar  newlinechar This takes a lot of experience and knowledge of anatomy to get at least semi-right if you do your animations by hand (which is why for most things, motion capture is prefered).

As they need that validation, and the internet is a great place to do that. Strangers will fall over themselves to tell a girl how pretty she is. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm guilty of it, I am sure most men are. newlinechar  newlinechar In a world that feels so connected I think we are lonelier than ever.

In theory, yes. In practice, not likely. To my knowledge of the different types of 3d printing I'm familiar with, none of them are able to utilize polymerization in the manufacturing.  newlinechar  newlinechar Besides, there would still be a lot of unreacted monomer stuck in the polymer matrix. Typically with nylon 6 and nylon 6,6 you can 'wash' out the caprolactam with boiling water or water vapor or other polar solvents like methanol, but most of the moneymaking for polyamides are in hot melt processing, after the macromolecule has been formed and frozen solid. newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, if the poly being used reacts at a high temperature, you could in theory use a laser or set of lasers to raise the temperature in a small portion of a solution to polymerize and build from there. One form of additive manufacting does exactly this, only by melting bits of a bed of powdered metal.

Your argument is totally valid. But I feel you're putting too much stock into the relevance of 'size'. Size was never the issue, popularity was.  newlinechar  newlinechar Netflix was getting money that the ISPs wanted a piece of, nothing more. It wasn't about the bandwidth they were using, both sides (Client and users) are paying for the bandwidth when they pay their monthly connection fees. But those connection fees are a fixed price, how much you use it or what you use it for doesn't change the cost. The ISPs want a piece of Netflix's pie. newlinechar  newlinechar LoL is one of, if not the, most popular games in the world. I would be very very shocked if the isps aren't doing anything to get a piece of that also.

Have no idea yet! I'll find out tomorrow when I go play ball.
I'm not dismissing the impact, that's why I said it's dated *now* ;) newlinechar  newlinechar I still remember being absolutely blown away when it came out. especially as I'd been reading the comics voraciously since '97 when I was 9 years old. X-Men was pretty cool in 2000 but Spider-Man was something else. Think I saw it twice in the cinema and countless times on DVD. Spider-Man 2 I definitely saw at least twice, if not 3 times in the cinema. newlinechar  newlinechar But rewatching it now, it *is* dated; some of the action is hokey, the cinematography is a bit flat, etc. The leap from Spider-Man to Spider-Man 2 is like the leap from Batman Begins to The Dark Knight for me; both in terms of cinematography and overall story, action, emotional resonance, the sequel surpasses the (still very good) original by far. Spider-Man and Batman Begins are a bit tougher for me to watch, whereas I never get sick of Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight (though my favourite of the latter trilogy is Rises). newlinechar  newlinechar I find the first two Spider-Man Raimi movies superior to nearly all the MCU films. Not that I dislike the recent Marvel Studios films, I enjoy them (only recently got round to watching them all), but they don't resonate with me emotionally like those 2 films do, and the action sequences are mostly so much CGI mush to me; what I like about them all is the humour (which the Raimi films were lacking, one of the few areas where I think the Webb films surpass them).

Well yeah they're dead, but I was trying to remind people that by drinking and driving you can hurt or kill yourself and others. 
I've been depressed for over 15 years. Nothing has happened so far that has made the past 15 years worth living. If I had killed myself then, I haven't experienced anything that would have been a loss. I've had some good memories, sure, but nothing that has made the unhappiness worth experiencing.  newlinechar  newlinechar It *can* get better, sure. But it most likely won't. To a depressed person, hearing 'It could be better' is the same as hearing, 'You could win the lottery!' For many, depression is a permanent mental illness. It can be treated but it isn't unusual to go through your entire life vaguely feeling as though killing yourself would be the best option. Look at Robin Williams, for instance. He had been getting treatment for over 40 years, but in the end it never went away and he got tired of it.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you feel that those who commit suicide are quitters, fine. I don't police peoples' opinions. I just want you to know what you're expecting these people to try to live through. Depression you experience for a short period of time is completely different from depression that lasts a long time and is relentless. I can see why a transsexual teenager living with fundie parents gave in.

You risk puncturing the pleural cavity that houses the lungs with a shot to the shoulder. If air enters the hole and fills the cavity as the diaphragm flexes, the lung can collapse and heavily restrict oxygen flow into the lung. If that happens the victim can simply suffocate to death.

A bandaged cube is one where certain pieces are attached ('bandaged') together, making it impossible to turn along a plane that cuts through the attached pieces.  You can buy already-bandaged cubes in various configurations (like [this one](http://thecubicle.us/witeden-bandaged-cube-p-1170.html)). newlinechar  newlinechar A bandagable cube, which is what the OP constructed, is a cube that can be configured into any variety of bandaged layouts.  By attaching Lego plates to each face, you can bandage any combination of pieces by attaching additional Lego plates on top of the faces, allowing you to create any possible bandaged configuration on a single cube.
What the Jews have done to piss off people in history newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Be different newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Continue to be different newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that they (or we, since I'm Jewish) have been persecuted across the globe for the better part of forever speaks more to intolerance for religious and ethnic diversity than some evil plot by the money grubbing Jews.  newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, Hitler's complaint about the Jews involved them being parasites in Germany and thus keeping down the ethnically superior Aryan race (which was a horrible misinterpretation of anthropology itself). This mostly arose from the Jewish influence on Weimar Germany, which had become a center for liberalism in the arts since the fall of the German Empire. The only thing the Jews did wrong was paint and write novels that were risqué and not traditionally German in the way Hitler saw Germanic culture. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, Hitler going a 'little overkill.' You do realize that he systematically murdered 11 million people for no reason other than pure unadulterated racism, right? There is a big gap between accepting Jews and forcing them into ghettos like most of Europe had done. There is a canyon or two between ghettos and genocide. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I love this. Guy says Hitler had some legitimate reasons for hating Jews and only went a little overkill and is at +5.

I would definitely start with the Premier league here in England/Wales. IT is one of the big 5 leagues in the world and probably the most competitive. It is also all covered in English which of course helps. Try not to just choose one of the best teams because part of the trhill of football is falling in love with your club and sticking with them through the highs and lows. If you live near an MLS team I would definitely support them and go to games as there is nothing like it.

They were a little more generous with cursing; somewhere, I remember reading that they got only one 'fuck' per episode but at least a few 'shit's. Also, there's an episode that's officially titled 'I.F.T.', which stands for Skyler telling Walt 'I fucked Ted.'

I see. I could live with it as long as she's one of those 'reasonable' Christians (almost an oxymoron, but I digress) and doesn't try to force it on me or freak out about it. Nearly all of my friends are Christians, but only one is rather religious. The rest are what I call Christian in Name Only. That is, they don't go to service (except maybe on Christmas, if then) and don't really do much of anything religion related, but still claim to be Christians and whatnot. None of my friends are any of these, afaik, but there are also the more liberal Christians like the Quakers, the Episcopalians, and some Lutherans. I'd have much less of a problem with her being one of these. I just wanted to say this somewhere. &lt;/rant&gt;

TBH I see where he's coming from. Melee's metagame is pretty much set in stone by now, and it's semi-true that past casual level, if you don't play in a particular way, you're going to get wrecked hard. The same is true for PM though. newlinechar  newlinechar Sakurai just wants to put everyone on as equal a footing as possible, which is simultaneously good and bad game design, because it punishes those who actually invest time in the game while trying to make the game more accessible, more noob-friendly. Melee and PM take from that notion, then run like hell in the exact opposite direction, much like games like Street Fighter do. It's a simple divergence of philosophy.  newlinechar  newlinechar There's no right or wrong, objectively speaking; an accessible game is good for sales, and good for newbies (ex: Call of Duty). An elitist game is good to form a community around skillful play (ex: Quake 3 Arena). Unfortunately the latter doesn't exactly bring tons of cash past a certain timeframe, and given that Nintendo cannot just sleep on its hits (because unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo has nothing to fall back on if a console tanks at retail; much like Sega's deal in the days of yore, and we all know how that shit ended), they prefer to get them monies. newlinechar  newlinechar Now I know HAL and Nintendo aren't the same entity (I think ?) and if Nintendo crashes, HAL can still be sold to a surviving company (and pray they don't get the same fate as Rareware), but that still holds true; If they want to keep doing games they like, they better get good numbers for Big N.

It's a great game, and I love the story, but the gameplay itself is imo very dated. I don't especially like how combat feels, particularly with the 'overheating system,' and I don't know that I've ever met anyone that feels that the combat from original was the best. Combat (one of the biggest components of gameplay) drastically improved over the course of the series. newlinechar  newlinechar The inventory management is horrendous, with an unimaginably clunky UI and dozens of items that have little use other than converting to omingel. What was omnigel for? Why, bypassing the tedious minigames that they eventually ditched entirely. Don't get me wrong, at first I really liked the minigames. But you know what? I didn't miss them when they were removed. And further, when I have gone back and done full playthroughs since then (about four or five) the minigames seem frankly tedious. They don't really add anything unless you really like tedium. newlinechar  newlinechar The faster, refined, tight gameplay/combat from the later games was, I think, a huge step up overall. I do decry the shrinking open world elements later on in the series. But anytime I do a full playthrough I think, 'Ok, fine, lets get through ME1 so I can get to 2 relatively quickly.' newlinechar  newlinechar And if you're opinion differs, that's fine. But I was responding to someone who had trouble getting into ME1. And if that's the case, there's a good chance they'll be like me and they'll find ME2 a breath of fresh air after the somewhat plodding manner of ME1. newlinechar  newlinechar ME1 had some great moments, but for me, and I'm sure others like me, it's my least fun to play because of dated game systems that have since then been very reasonably phased out. newlinechar  newlinechar

Thanks, looks a little sketchy but I'll update this post in 14 minutes if it's working!
No problem at ALL, man!
What are you taking about?
It still makes sense now damnit.
So, this isn't the new site? This is the existing site and you're asking for ideas?
Gracias.
And ginormous pains in the butt to maintain en mass. Sys Admins, DC techs, mah homies know what Imma talk 'bout. 
Haha, well I'm more than willing to amend my terminology to 'simpler'. Is that better? :)
I was thinking the same thing as I read. He lost me an partially my kid.. That's a lot. 
I hated firing people. I did it, but I freaking hated it.  newlinechar  newlinechar I never took a job that I expected to stay with in my life.  newlinechar  newlinechar I fired people that had worked for the same corporation for up to 15 years. I was just 'passing through' and ruining people's lives.
Please give me some time to contact you sorry,  friend had a lung collapse and I'm staying at the hospital tonight in ER
I could definitely use more coursework. I've taken applied linear algebra, applied linear regression and have worked my way through about half of Boyd's Convex Optimization book. I would like to go to grad school but would like an internship first where I'm exposed to more of this so I can learn more about it.
According to OP's original post: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; My Ndad wasn't always an N. Growing up he was the best father anyone could ask for.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; My dads narcissism slowly emerged in the years following his accidents. It began with severe mood swings and paranoia, which eventually evolved into fantasies of self-importance and a desire for complete control of the entire family. newlinechar  newlinechar This is consistent with degenerative brain disease triggered by traumatic brain injury.  I really feel sorry for him AND his family.  He was doing his job and suffered traumatic brain injuries, and he was just left to disintegrate, destroying his own life and his family's lives.   newlinechar  newlinechar Our legal system is a total mess when it comes to severe mental illness, insisting on treating obvious symptoms of mental illness beyond the person's control as 'exercising their freedom', and insisting that the law can't interfere with their 'rights' to 'freedom'.  And then after they kill or permanently maim one or more people (or dozens, as in the cases of Adam Lanza and Seung-Hui Cho), it seems like the whole country starts another round of wailing about how their needs to be more funding for mental health 'treatment', completely ignoring the fact that these people routinely refuse treatment, and the law doesn't allow them to be forced until *after* severe, irreparable harm has been done.
How about I post my responses in the way I see fit - since someone who sees things as simply 100% needs a little clarification in their life.  newlinechar  newlinechar I used to get my fix from [CIR](http://cironline.org/), though I admittedly haven't listened to them in awhile. Their works vary - some is more Serial-esque while others stayed 'just the facts ma'am.  newlinechar  newlinechar Awhile back I was listening to True Murder as well. The difference here is that the podcast is just a forum to interview crime writers. So basically, you're getting the writer injecting his thoughts via the JO's show. It'd be like if someone (let's say you at your station) interviewed Koenig about Serial. Lots of self-injection though. newlinechar  newlinechar I worked at ProPublica for a bit and this method was actually getting quite popular for presentation - though it was less investigative and more presentation of facts/figures/policy.  newlinechar  newlinechar Ultimately I think you and I are going to need to agree to disagree. I really didn't see SK as a center of the piece. I agree with what you said about the abnormal nature of the podcast - but given my discussions with work associates, we felt she made it very clear where she was being personal vs. when she wasn't.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's New Years Eve, and I have no desire to spend it arguing in circles with someone who basically just disagrees with me on something that can't be confirmed, so I'll go with this: Serial is different, I'll grant you. We hear a lot from SK and I suspect a good part of that has to do with its TAL roots as well as the length of the format. But I would also point out there's a world of difference between Serial and the 3-part Jay interview and the decorum in which the two presenters handled the information. I asked you to see the difference earlier and you can't...not much else I can do for you. newlinechar  newlinechar Happy New Year.

Well, if by 'once' you mean for days, weeks, and months (and sometimes even years) on end, then by 'twice' you really would have the hang of things. I only breastfed for 13 months, but that 'once' taught me a lot, and I'll be prepared when my 'second' time comes around.

Awesome.  I guess i was confused by the phrases, 'make a ranged spell attack' (eg. fire bolt) and 'make a melee spell attack' (eg shocking grasp). newlinechar  newlinechar So there's no difference in the attack modifiers between these two. The only difference is the spell's range, correct?

Too soon to tell at this point.  I had some complications (bleeding) that caused me to have to go to the ER and get admitted.

Nope you're completely right, my bad, watched an overhead replay and that's what it looks like. (he didn't hack at the puck until it was already in the net though) But, the puck was in the crease before Lazar was. Once the puck is in the crease, it's everyone's crease. The contact he made with Demko was pretty minimal, he didn't run him over or anything. Call could have gone either way but regardless goal or not, Canada earned that game.

I remember when Alistair called her Princess Stabbibity-stab. Good times.
Hence why a movie needs to be judged in the context of its own time--that's my point.  Saying it's 'dated' means you're comparing it to modern releases or by modern standards.  Instead, look at how far we've come since the 90s and David Hasslehoff's Nick Fury.

The difficulty with any Japanese names with an R is that you are either going to bastardize the pronunciation into an English hard-R or you are going to have an name no one can pronounce correctly. I'd recommend OP avoid Japanese names with R.
I disagree with none of that. Although honestly, I always thought the idea was spectacularly subjective anyway. Even if we did call it 'best QB', everyone has different ideas of what qualities are important or unimportant anyway. Thing is, sports people usually want to distill everything into a straight 1-2-3-4 progression of 'superiority' even if it doesn't really make sense in the apples compared to oranges world of the NFL.

I feel like Netflix series fit street level heroes better than normal films. They don't require as many special effects and they also have a longer amount of time to develop the characters. newlinechar  newlinechar If the MCU does get ahold of Spidey, it would be interesting to get a Netflix series instead of an actual film for him. Or-- if the costs to show Spidey's powers are too high, a Netflix cartoon series? But not one designed for kids or to sell toys, a more mature one.

I'm a huge CoD fan but I'm one of the few who didn't enjoy Black Ops 2 but loved the first. The way they have the series set up right now, I think Sledgehammer will be in charge of futuristic games or have an Advanced Warfare trilogy. Infinity Ward will have the Ghosts series and will be in charge of any present day games. And then Treyarch will be in charge of WW2, Vietnam War, Cold War ect. That's what would make the most sense to me. I can't see them releasing 3 modern shooters every year especially with Battlefield branching off into different styles of games with Hardline. 
Good to hear someone else loves it as much as me! I was so disappointed the first time I ordered it from bombies cause I decided to try 30ml of tiger style and only 15ml of Seas. It was gone in less than 5 days.
Kind of, although late is not actually late. As far as I remember from previous years it all closes at about 2 which is not late enough for a night out.  At least, whenever I left a night out on New Years it was already closed. Having said that, this is the first year I decided to not bother and stay inside so they may have changed it. You'd have to ask someone who isn't on reddit :p 
And yourself.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now why can't all discussions on this website go this well?

By rules. Yes they are. So is art. Art is useless for the card. But the visuals do affect the feel of the card. How many people do you know that buy full art basics despite the fact that those offer no advantage over regular basics? newlinechar  newlinechar EDH is all about the feel of the cards, or at least the feel of the cards has a much bigger part than it does in other formats. So don't be surprised when people say some cards shouldn't be played on grounds of flavor. newlinechar  newlinechar I am not saying that they shouldn't be played. All I am saying is that we shouldn't ignore those who offer a contrasting viewpoint especially if they stand on grounds of flavor.

Your original comment newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I'd more equate it to you see two people pull out guns and both shoot at each other once, then you sit there eating your bigmacs watching until a stray bullet hits you in the arm. newlinechar  newlinechar No one stayed around once the cloud reached them, it started to hurt people and the only person who is seen not moving is the dude way in the back who it hadn't reached yet.

If you call for a fair catch, you still have to get to the ball and actually catch it before it hits the ground.  The GB player who attempted to catch it was not one who signaled for a fair catch.  The GB players who signaled for a fair catch were not contacted by an opposing player.  The ball definitely hit the ground.  At that point, its open to the other team.

There's just too much uncertainty involved. You might be able to say that certain types of writing were *generally* to be taken literally, but that won't get you specifics when it comes to each passage. On top of that, each individual writer would bring his own set of beliefs. And even further, we aren't certain about what was changed and how accurate of a representation the current writing is compared to the original. It's also been translated. In many cases the story was an oral tradition for a while before it was written down. And in other cases, we already flat out know that some of the text has been changed, and we have no way of knowing what the original was. newlinechar  newlinechar We can barely have any certainty about the true nature of a single hydrogen atom, and you believe we can be reasonably certain about God's intentions for us as transcribed through a group of ancient writers?

Can confirm. Was at the premiere in Cannes. After the movie when we gave it a standing ovation, Schultz was in tears. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I just need to say, though, that I honestly think the homoeroticism is something that I think critics are reading way too much into. When I saw the movie, I never ever thought there was any homosexual nature in the relationship between du Pont and Schultz. I always got the creepy factor to be from the main theme of the film being how little the rich look at the poor. In fact, I think sexualizing their relationship REALLY undercuts that major point of the movie.

If it doesn't work for you I could just pop up the relevant mod files on Dropbox or something, let me know. newlinechar  newlinechar Along the same lines, I can mention a few more mods I like (not necessarily the names, but what they do): newlinechar  newlinechar * Cheaper Workboats - I really hate how prohibitively expensive workboats are for how finite they are compared to land workers that can stick around forever, and that mod makes them like ~90 gold or just a small amount of production, either being built in one turn in most cities or a few turns in a younger city. newlinechar  newlinechar * All Scouts get the Shoshone Ancient Ruin Bonus - I think that's an incredibly powerful bonus for allowing you to quickly get a free tech or go straight to no terrain penalty archers and composite bows (even potentially getting free techs in the late game if some ruins are still around), so I think it's fairer to make every civ's scout be able to do it. The barbarian encampment and map of surrounding area ruins are totally worthless IMO and this mod incentivizes always using scouts for ruins if you can to pick something better than that garbage. You can still pick up ruins with other units but lose the ability to choose, and I think that's an interesting strategic decision whether you always keep around scouts for that or just use your starting warrior or whatever. newlinechar  newlinechar * Separate Great People Counters - This is probably a fairly well known mod but it means you don't have to min-max your great scientist and great engineer points anymore. You just get more great people over the course of the game, allowing you to use them in potentially interesting ways, and great merchants are no longer a pain in the ass but rather something you can plant or pop. newlinechar  newlinechar * Fixed Great Prophets - Prophets spawn as soon as you hit the faith threshold pre-Industrial era instead of it being a random chance. I think the random chance is completely garbage game design and this mod fixes that. Highly recommended. newlinechar  newlinechar * All Siege Units Indirect Fire - I think it's very weird how only a fairly limited amount of siege units get indirect fire so this mod changes that. Makes some earlier siege units nicer when you can have a melee unit as a spotter or whatever rather than having to put the siege unit potentially in harm's way by being adjacent to a city with a melee garrison or something. newlinechar  newlinechar * Faster cultural border expansion - I think the Tradition opener is just too good for this, so it means non-Tradition AI has a chance at decent tile expansion, and Tradition empires will expand quite far to reduce holes in borders and stuff and just generally control more area even if they can't necessarily work it. Can also prevent you from having to use a great general to get a strategic resource just outside of the workable range, which is nice. The mod was actually still too slow for my taste so I reduced border expands to 1/3 the normal cultural cost, and I feel it works well, though of course with like EUI it will spam cultural border notifications eventually. newlinechar

&gt;I believe sugar does not lead to diabetes (according to my nutrition text book),    newlinechar  newlinechar This is absolutely untrue, and if your nutrition textbook says that then you should write in to the author and tell them that was absolutely wrong and they should feel bad (unless it's from like 1990). Sugar is the biological killer, not fat (though high fat, and high protein can also be bad in different ways). Simple carbohydrates are bad for 1) Usually low micronutrient value (vitamins/minerals) and 2) simple carbohydrates raise your blood glucose much more than complex carbohydrates.   newlinechar  newlinechar There is obviously a lot more to it, actual bio/chemical science, but this is the basic principle. http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/carbs.html http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/what-can-i-eat/understanding-carbohydrates/glycemic-index-and-diabetes.html   newlinechar  newlinechar A lot of things can cause diabetes. Poor diet is the main contributor, lack of exercise is another. Poor diet (such as a diet high in sugar and refined carbohydrates), even for someone who is in great shape, can be linked to virtually every major chronic health problem.

Cancer and diabetes are probably the most problematic. newlinechar  newlinechar **note** Some aspects of medical science, including dietary science, are kind of a crap in shoot. Some people say whole wheat bread is absolutely fine, others say it's fine but oats/rice/quinoa are better sources of complex carbs.

Agree to disagree. I thought he was perfectly in character, specially following his character developent as king in the comics. Most people didn't recognize him because of his new haircut, not because of the writing (for all the writing you get in the two seconds that scene lasts). newlinechar  newlinechar I get that some people think he should be all happy and cute like a cuddly puppy forever, but life doesn't work like that, specially for the ruler of an entire nation.

&gt; So neither should taxpayers, who by all accounts had absolutely nothing to do with the birth of child at all.  newlinechar  newlinechar Taxpayers do not have parental obligations. Paying taxes for a social safety net is not equivalent to parental obligations. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Why shouldn't taxes be opt-in? newlinechar  newlinechar Employment and commercial dealings, among others, are opt-in. Taxes are not. There is no contradiction. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It stands to reason that if I shouldn't have to pay for a child I never wanted, that extends to taxes that pay for said child. newlinechar  newlinechar No, it does not. newlinechar  newlinechar I should not have to pay for a car that I don't want to buy. Everyone can agree on that. Does that mean that if the government decides to subsidize domestic car manufacturers, I should not have to pay taxes that go towards that subsidy?  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And thems the breaks, I'm sorry to say.  newlinechar  newlinechar That is the case currently. That should be changed.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; My point is that switching to an 'opt-in system' changes almost everything around our society newlinechar  newlinechar No it doesn't. Many, many things are already opt-in. Changing parental obligations to opt-in would not change any logical arguments about taxes.

Haha yes I was trying to remember where I heard that from.
It's unlikely she was talking about the storm of the 8th, because, as you said, school was canceled that day. And the next two days were Saturday and Sunday, so there never would have been school anyway.  newlinechar  newlinechar So what day could she have been talking about? It didn't snow the rest of January after MLK day. The next time it snowed was February 12. So it's possible she's talking about that day. But by then, Hae's body had been found. It would seem highly unusual for Asia to specifically remember talking to Adnan about breaking up with Hae after Hae's body was found. newlinechar  newlinechar It also snowed the week of February 23. So she could have been talking about those days, I suppose. But it didn't seem to snow enough to close school for 2 days. And Hae's body had already been found so, again, talking to Adnan about breaking up with Hae would not have happened. Adnan was arrested on the 28th, so it couldn't have been any day after that.  newlinechar  newlinechar The only day that fits Asia's description (a storm so severe that it cancelled two days of school and she was talking to Adnan about breaking up with Hae) was January 13th. Any earlier and they weren't broken up. Any later and Hae was already dead. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, that thread is nitpicking. It complains because SK said that there was an ice storm on the night of the 13th, but that storm didn't actually start until the 14th. Completely irrelevant. If you go to sleep on the 13th and wake up to a storm, it doesn't actually matter is the storm started at 11:59 pm on the 13th or 12:01 am on the 14th. What matters is that the storm canceled school on the 14th.

You're definitely right about how big of an impact his cap hit would have. But every Bills fan has said the offense was underperforming under Marrone. Cutler is a good QB. I don't think it's crazy to think that they'd have high odds to get into the playoffs, even with a new HC. Not because he's a great QB, but because he's at least an improvement on what they had this year. And they were right in the mix. newlinechar  newlinechar I know the dream is to draft a franchise QB and build around the draft and undervalued player in FA. But they aren't going to be bad enough any time soon to a top 3 QB talent and when you havent made the playoffs in 16 years, you have to do something to change that now.

&gt; Yeah, even then, if there was a spin off and he appeared even once to be the villain that would be his 4th attempt already on OUAT's timeline and that is just ridiculous. His last plot was just soo nonsensical...But oh well,before anything is to hope the spin off happens on the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar It's already ridiculous, but a 4th attempt would be completely over the top.  As for a spin off I'm somewhat confident it will happen as long as Disney allows it, cause the show's ratings got a huge boost from the Frozen arc.  If not a spin off maybe Anna and Elsa will return to the main show for another arc. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't have a link, but wasn't there an interview with Tyler Jacob Moore (Hans) earlier in the season talking about Hans' story picking up with his return to the Southern Isles after the events of the movie?  Since that didn't happen it's possible that he accidentally revealed something from the spin off instead of season 4A.  Maybe there's a spin off in the works set during the 2 years between Frozen and OUaT Season 4A. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Mmm, well I went back to the OUAT fandom giving that the season was over and there was no more spoilers, and at least on the places I hang out, the Frozen arc was actually liked by a majority. newlinechar  newlinechar I saw a lot of hate from the Once subreddit and certain podcasts, but I don't know. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Yeah , it was good that Disney made the AU non-canonical when they bought SW. newlinechar  newlinechar Disney didn't do that, the books were never canonical.  The Force Unleashed games are canon, but other than that it's all a bunch of contradicting alternate universes. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I guess in any case it would be good if a part of the expanded frozen stuff wasn't canonical after all, at least if they start mixing things up. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know, from what I've seen the Elsa and Anna series of books at least is basically just sisterly fluff set after the movie, nothing that's likely to be contradicted in Frozen 2 as long as they set it a couple years after the first movie or something like that. newlinechar  newlinechar I really just want more canon Frozen.  Like I know we're getting Frozen Fever and that's canon, but I would like for the books to be canon too.

Thing is, you can say the exact opposite for abortion. If women don't want kids so badly but want to sleep with the whole town, they should get their tubes tied by your logic. The reason that doesn't work is that a vasectomy (or tying tubes) is a *permanent* procedure. Why should men be forced to waive their reproductive rights for life just to not have to deal with children? They shouldn't is the answer to that question.

In arcade they are basically a kill streak reward, you need to kill two enemies to get into a medium bomber/attacker, or three to get into a heavy bomber. The plane is randomly selected from a specific list, you do *not* bring your own planes to the fight. Once you killed the required amount of enemies and there is no air battle in progress, the button will light up and you can press the shortcut to start an air attack run. Two other players from each team can join in fighters to defend or intercept you. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar In RB you have a certain number of points available at the beginning of the match. You bring your own aircraft and tanks, each of them costs a certain amount of points to deploy.

Interesting, thanks!
When you're talking about physical traits, I'm glad that I have a womanly voice, face and shape, sure. I'd feel a little miffed if someone told me I was manly in some physical way because being physically womanly pleases me. I like to look traditionally feminine with long hair and shaved legs and makeup and dresses; it's fun. I totally get why a guy who wants to look physically manly would be unhappy at being told he looked feminine in some fashion. Nothing sexist about wanting to look like a magnificent hunk of hot hot manliness/womanliness.  newlinechar  newlinechar When you're talking about professions and capabilities, though, you're treading on far shakier ground because these things aren't just superficial; they have very real implications for how a person lives, and saying that, for example, having women enter STEM fields en masse makes some men uncomfortable cannot be easily solved by saying, 'Okay, ladies, back to the secretarial pool with you.' That genie is out of the bottle, and she's working in your lab or studio or boardroom.  newlinechar  newlinechar When you describe wanting to keep women out of male-centric parts of life, the unfortunate side effect is keeping women *down*. I'm not saying that's what you intend; I don't believe you do, and I appreciate your having a real discussion about something I'm seeing in a new light. That's the net effect, though, of suggesting men must have somewhere away from women to retreat to retain their manliness.  newlinechar  newlinechar While women have visibly moved into areas that used to be exclusively male, men have quietly moved into areas that used to be overwhelmingly female domains. Nurses, teachers, stay-at-home parents -- guys can do these things now, and as far as I know, there hasn't been a huge backlash from women claiming it makes them feel unfeminine to have male nurses and nannies. No one has said, 'Now that men take an unabashed delight in caring for their children, how can I still feel feminine?'  newlinechar  newlinechar That's what I'm getting at: There's still a presumption there, unconscious though it may be, that femininity is less than masculinity, that women therefore lower the intrinsic value of something by making it less masculine when they participate in 'traditional men things.' You wonder 'If anyone can do it, how is it masculine,' but I don't know that any woman thinks that way about femininity. I don't think I'm less feminine if you, a man, do something I traditionally do. I don't think we ever tell other girls they 'hug like a boy' or 'sew like a boy' or 'cook like a boy' and mean it as an insult.  newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, 'you throw like a girl' is an insult -- ask any third-grader. It's an insult, and it's *abso-fucking-lutely* meant to be one. So is 'you cry like a girl,' 'you run like a girl,' 'you dance like a girl,' and any of its corollaries. These things aren't said to girls and women as an accurate and neutral assessment of their skills; they're said to boys and men to demean them because in the speaker's mind, being compared to a girl is *a very bad thing*.  newlinechar  newlinechar I want to live in a world in which doing things 'like a girl' is not automatically considered less good than doing things 'like a boy.' When that happens, maybe we'll stop worrying about whether having a woman as a company's CEO somehow takes away from men's masculinity. newlinechar  newlinechar

Pay needs to improve.

I won't go in to details but they fucked me around for two years over a 'problem' that was utterly and completely insignificant. newlinechar  newlinechar Some consideration needs to be given to changing the way return of service obligations work too.

The key is double trapping each beast. With 3 friends they all double trap the same beast. They are getting 6 crates per beast. Lets say they stockpile and want 100 crates on each character to last them 3 weeks. Thats going to take them 50 beasts. Since double trapping is OP, and they have 3 people they can knock out 50 beasts in under a hour. Do that on 6-7 characters each over the course of a week.

Here is my intuition based judgements on the Red Bull trio based on their junior career, watching them drive, their adaptability. newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Vettel is very good. He is up there with drivers like Button, Bottas, Hulkenberg. He is a strong driver who given a dominant car will win consistently. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Vergne is more or less on a similar level to that, he is a weaker qualifier than Vettel but a stronger racer.  newlinechar  newlinechar 3) Ricciardo is a step above those two, but not quite in the league of Alonso-Hamilton. He skirts around about below those top two and there is no driver really on 'his level', just drivers below and above. newlinechar  newlinechar To me when you look at their performances around their entire career, against the team mates they've faced and just watching how they drive that is the likely option. I fail to believe that Vettel is just average and Ricciardo is above average, but nor do I think they're the two best drivers on the grid. I suspect they're towards the front, but not at the very top. newlinechar  newlinechar But now that Vettel has left the Red Bull family and gone to Ferrari, especially with Raikkonen looking ready to retire in coming seasons its very likely we will see him against a range of team mates, maybe Bottas or Hulkenberg. Maybe a driver we haven't even heard of yet.

I am not implying politicians shouldn't be paid, plus if you look at our current model, they get paid well compared to the average citizen and that still isn't enough for the party so they get 'political donations' in return for  favours to business, but this is a whole other thing.   newlinechar  newlinechar What my title was about is that they get paid well for what they do, a chunk of them don't do it because of the goodness in their heart, they do it for money/ perks/ power etc. It is just a job.  newlinechar  newlinechar There is an expectation from politicians now that if they do a few terms they will get a certificate for doing their job. They get paid pretty well for this, this more than reward for most of them.   newlinechar  newlinechar I think the honours system should be for people who selflessly give up their own time and resources to help others, not in exchange for money but just actually helping fellow human beings other things that coexist on our planet, people who put their own lives at risk to save strangers.

The R210 II is extremely quiet, especially for a 1U server. The switch is considerably louder.  newlinechar  newlinechar That said, start loading up the CPU and it can get very loud, but it does a great job at modulating the fans.

Short rails exist but sellers want too much for them especially considering they're not that desirable apparently. Mine is sitting on top of an upside down 2u shelf at the moment.

Yep, I see that as one of the cost of big budget games, or rather where every cent spent must be justified when they're not cheap to make.  newlinechar  newlinechar The weird thing is that Thief was a long project, announced earlier than DE:HR. There were rumors before release that it was a troubled project, so I imagine the project was reset a few times, and time on the final version wasn't enough to spend on the world. It's weird, because 'the world' should be a strength of the immersive sim type game that is part of Thief, and they should have known this as it was developed at the same studio that made DE:HR.
The thing I like about it is that it's 'real', compared to most anime.  I do NOT mean real as in 'An accurate representation of reality', but as in 'Not including magical schoolgirls and people flying through the air and hovering in drama poses and transforming into vampire tentacle monsters and such'.  I don't watch much anime, mostly because 99% of what I see all looks like the latter category, to me.  Initial D, by contrast, gives me young street racers doing (semi)real things with real cars and no one's developed the ability to change into a ninja superheroine yet, so it's a world that I recognize and relate to.  
Nah I used to work for the city, I traveled from Austin for the work. We did work on the acequia (imagine a clever irrigation system) that used to connect to all the missions, including the Alamo. Pretty neat little feature that not a lot of folks know about that still functions to this day.

&gt;Naturalism accepts that the universe can come from nothing and information can spontaneously generate. newlinechar  newlinechar Naturalism doesn't currently have anything to say on the cause of the big bang.  As a viewpoint, everything (including information) comes about through natural properties and causes, but this is a far cry from 'spontaneous generation'. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So simple we don't understand them. newlinechar  newlinechar Many simple things have been poorly understood, and religion has always tried to provide supernatural 'explanations'.  Zeus still isn't the cause of thunderbolts, and thankfully a naturalistic world view happens to be quite good at achieving improved understandings. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Right... the convoluted idea that instead of inflating the probabilities for a miracle to occur via an ad-hoc speculation... newlinechar  newlinechar The irony here is that you used this statement after speculating in our earlier conversation that the earth just happens to miraculously be at the exact center of the entire universe which as we now know consists of countless galaxies, let alone stars and planets. newlinechar  newlinechar Insisting that your deity is capable of magic and real doesn't make 'god' any better of an answer than it has when used by any of the other adherants of gods throughout all of history. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; To rule out this possibility is to exercise faith. newlinechar  newlinechar If the odds are infinity to 1 against something, it doesn't take any leap of faith to rule it out.  This is exactly what the odds are that the earth just happens to be the center of the universe, and the odds against your bronze age deity are probably worse.  I wouldn't call that eloquent or logical. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I conclude that the evidence supports God. newlinechar  newlinechar You have yet to present any evidence other than the remotest impossiblity for the claim of geocentrism or your religion.  There are an infinite number of near impossibilities, including every lie and fiction ever conceived or yet to be conceived. Currently geocentrism and your religion have done nothing to seperate themselves from that number.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;... at their own peril. newlinechar  newlinechar Tacking on a threat to the end of your reply to try to get people to consider your particular specutive impossibility perhaps says something about you and your religion.

I still have them sometimes.  newlinechar  newlinechar For example at work the other day something wasn't going right for a client and he had to get on a flight in half an hour. I knew how to fix the problem with his laptop, that he needed for this trip, but I also knew there was a chance it could royally screw everything up. So it could take 20 minutes to fix if all goes right, or 3 hours to fix if it all went wrong. It all went wrong. So I'm running to my desk to go get a spare computer for him, and my stress is at a 10! the dude I was helping is laid back but you could tell he was pretty upset.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm running to my desk and the receptionist (an older very nice lady) wiggles her finger for me to follow her and I knew that in my state, I could easily blow, so I have to tighten my lips, keep quiet, and keep moving. She says 'NO FOLLOW ME!' and I yelled at her. 'NO I CAN'T, I'M BUSY!!'. I apologized later and told her I was in a very peculiar mood and should never happen. Its just that my dad just drowned a few months ago and I've been at the extremes mood-wise. newlinechar  newlinechar Another dude totally fucked up his order for new employees computers and when they didn't show up, I found that he had ordered only 1 and put in the comments 'I need three of these'. That doesn't work, you need to order 3 systems if you want three. I threw my hands up in the air and scoffed. I realized that was rather rude of me, and again apologized later in the day for my response.  newlinechar  newlinechar 3 years ago my little brother died unexpectedly and 2 weeks later I was with my spouse in the store and we got separated. As I wandered looking for him and his friends in wal-mart. I was getting more and more upset. I was getting so stressed for no good reason (just emotional) and punched a hole in a box of merchandise. Finally found him and started crying that I couldn't find him and I was angry.  newlinechar  newlinechar I know I have problems with my emotions coming out and constantly working on ways to deal with stress. Its a battle I'm winning every day. I really do try.

Once the vehicle is immobilized, it becomes the property of the police department in the sense that the driver is not permitted to move it without paying their outstanding fines or, for unusual cases, receiving permission from the commander on duty. So it wouldn't be their property, it would be ours. Regardless, it's theft to take the device with them once they remove it. I suppose that leaves them with either taking the device with them (theft) or destroying it and leaving it behind (destruction of property), so either way they're left with charges of some sort.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would be curious, however, to see a case where someone manages to pick the lock and leave the device. Can't charge them with theft, can't charge them with destruction of property. Sounds like a win for them, in my book.

Dated to me means of its time, and to me the CGI, occasionally ho-hum action, and by-the-numbers origin story structure dates it to that era. I'm not denying that at the time it was revolutionary, in the same way Star Wars was back in '77. But while Star Wars has dated in its own way as well, I think it holds up in ways that Spider-Man doesn't; the basic story structure of Star Wars is the timeless Hero's Journey myth, to me the script for the '02 Spider-Man has that early noughties restricted origin story structure (which as you said is still leaps and bounds above what came before). Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight are rid of those story shackles and shoehorned-in awkward CGI, and also are more daring in their cinematography (Pfister specifically says that in a quote for TDK), and as such are more timeless to me. They could both be replaced today and I'd believe they were shot in the past year. newlinechar  newlinechar I was so desperate to see a Marvel movie as a kid I nearly rented that Hasselhoff Fury from the video store.

I'm just stabbing in the dark here, but it seems to me like a statement on the connection between the salvia experience and real life. At first glance the 'life' markers appear to encompass the entire bar, with the salvia experience ('sally') being just a subset of life. However, if you consider the shades of those markers and bars then the story is quite different. The shade of the salvia markers is the same as the shade of the larger bar that the life markers originally *appeared* to encompass, while the shade of those life markers is the same as the smaller middle bar; looking at it this way would indicate that life is a subset of the salvia experience. newlinechar  newlinechar The only way I can explain it further is to inject the symbology with my impressions I've gleaned from my few salvia experiences, but what the hell, it seems like a fun thing to do. To me this seems to mean that salvia (or at least, the things which salvia reveals to us) is/are a truth far larger than our lives, even though at first we see it the other way around (i.e. we think that the salvia experience is just the effect of a single, strange plant on our otherwise all-encompassing lives). My experiences with salvia have shown me a terrifyingly beautiful whirlwind of chaos, and so to me this image says that our lives are just part of the salvia experience, merely a subset of the endless chaos contained in that realm. It doesn't seem like an oppressive message, though; it's not necessary to read it from one direction or the other, so we can simultaneously contain the salvia experience within us just as it contains us within it. newlinechar  newlinechar Or something. I should probably have been more/less high when writing this ;)

&gt;You can snip all you want, but it's a historical fact that most of the natural wealth of Siberia and the Russian Far East was not exploitable, sometimes until after the World War II era. newlinechar  newlinechar First, there is plenty of material wealth in the russian west, and second,  russian siberian wealth was, if anything more easily exploitable than Alaskan wealth, which the US managed to get at pretty well.  Why?  because the US had a policy, at least up until the 1920s, of giving away land to anyone who was willing to use it for some productive end.  Russia had just about the opposite policy, formally binding serfs to the land until the 1860s, and only eliminating the last vestiges of those restrictions in the early 20th century.  The railroads in russia were not built by russian Leland Stanfordoviches, but by the ministry of rail, so it is hardly suprising that the US built more rail miles by 1860 than the russians had by 1905.  Again, choices were made, and choices have consequences.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I'm also not talking about stuff that meets the technical definition of arable land. Kansas isn't fucking Siberia. It's ridiculous to compare the two and you know it newlinechar  newlinechar Siberia, and russia, is a massive fucking place, it isn't all snow and caribou.  I've been there, and it's perfectly habitable.  And if you had offered to give it to whatever peasant got there first, it would have been settled. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Free trade doesn't have anything to do with this. They were completely free to trade.   newlinechar  newlinechar trade in china even after the opium wars was very extremely restricted by the imperial government, as it had been for centuries, with monopolies on many important goods, imperial manipulation of grain prices, and limits on merchants borne out of confucian dislike of commerce. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They fought wars to force the Chinese government into rescinding limitations and protectionism against foreign trade, and made China completely open to (unwanted) Western business newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Isn't it funny how 400 million chinese couldn't resist british imperialism, but a few million americans could?  Again, it's almost like some societies are more successful than others! newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The fact that they continue to be unable or unwilling to do much with it in the 21st century bodes poorly for the hypothesis that they could or should have done something differently with it in the 1800's. newlinechar  newlinechar or more proof that brazil makes poor choices. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Yes I do, and given some of America's potential competitors having been hamstrung by weird internal issues,  newlinechar  newlinechar good thing the US [never had any of those.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War)  But, of course, you miss the point.  those weird internal issues are not random outliers, they are not noise.  they come about as a result of decisions societies make.  Not, as you rightly point out, in a conscious manner, but choices are still made.  Russian czars chose not to give away eastern land, the US chose to give away western.

Anytime yo. I got a few other tricks up my sleeve for ya too.  newlinechar  newlinechar A low dose 6-8-10mg loperamide can do wonders for RLS.

Yeah, like you're a bosy builder. Helps get all your aminos and rebuild receptors.  newlinechar  newlinechar Exercise! Totally a MUST. Nothing! Will turn you around quicker than getting your heart rate up to max once a day, even for just a few minutes. Gah, it sucks to start, but actually isn't bad once started and it hyperdrives your endogenous opioid system. Seriously, you might feel naturally high from it and sleep like a baby.

It helps so much, but at 10 days I don't know that you need it.

Yes, the needs of the child need to be met.  An irresponsible and selfish mother is ill-suited to meet those needs.  By giving handouts to woman who have children they know they can't support you encourage them to have more.  Better to take the children and adopt them out. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Let's not forget that the man in our situation could have avoided it early on. He has full rights to prevent a pregnancy before it happens. newlinechar  newlinechar He can try.  Birth control doesn't always work, and some women are less than honest about precautions being taken.  The woman could have avoided sex too, if we're really going to play this game. newlinechar  newlinechar By carrying a child to term you are unable to support you are literally creating a problem you want someone else to solve.  If you listen carefully you'll hear the sound of the world's smallest violin.
&gt; As more and more women start doing the things that used to define men, men don't know how to be a man.  newlinechar  newlinechar Do you think that's true of women, though? As men have become more open to traditionally feminine things, are women no longer sure of how to be women? I haven't noticed that, and I think the difference is that there's still an underlying level of socialization that suggests femininity is less than masculinity.  newlinechar  newlinechar Women aren't afraid of losing their femininity as men move into spaces that used to be exclusively feminine because we aren't socialized to believe masculinity is lower than femininity. On the contrary -- men can readily move into those spaces and be praised for it. It's kind of how women can dress in masculine or tomboyish clothes and be thought cute, but men who dress in feminine clothes are generally mocked or reviled. It's because women are seen as taking a step up; men are subconsciously seen as taking a step down.  newlinechar  newlinechar

:( That's what drives me to post. Haha. newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, we are looking into marriage therapy to manage communications like this. We really love each other, and we both work really hard in our careers and for our family. We even have a good time together, 85% of the time. :) But when we bump heads, it's over both of us 'being right' and feeling like the other person isn't given our view its fair due. We're often after the same end result. I just happen to be right more often than him and it hurts his feelings (I kid! I kid!). ;)
&gt;which made it even more confusing for me to see how it's so often been given to celebrities lately newlinechar  newlinechar That's from a misunderstanding of what an honour or knighthood is, and for what they're given out. newlinechar  newlinechar People such as Elton John aren't given it just for inspiring work, but usually for other aspects in what they do in their position, like charity work, or making a major difference in the lives of the people (and not just by being inspirational).  newlinechar  newlinechar In fact, that's what Elton John was given a knighthood for - for his charitable services. Not his music. And it's what Bill Gates received a knighthood for (however as a foreigner and American, he's not allowed to use 'sir' (American being the US law doesn't recognise nor allow these type of things, and that non-commonwealthers aren't permitted to use these titles). newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar In reality, the monarch does not have any personal involvement in deciding who receives an honour or who is knighted. The people nominated, by anyone, goes through a committee, and then the Prime Minister 'advises' (tells the monarch) who she is going to honour or knight. newlinechar  newlinechar So the personal involvement that's necessary for a monarch to 'disagree' when another is crowned isn't present. It's not convention and will not be done anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar People who receive honours or knighthoods can refuse them themselves, or have them removed if they commit a crime. More likely if the crime was related to the reason for which they received the honour or knighthood. newlinechar  newlinechar If people are sentenced to prison for at least three months, or something like a doctor being struck off for malpractice, or any other reason, these cases go to the Honours Forfeiture Committee who then recommend to the monarch via the Prime Minister whether it should be removed or not. newlinechar  newlinechar As to whether the monarch in this instance personally decides or not, or whether she will still act on the advice of the PM as is convention, I'm not sure. It's entirely possible for her to decide, and that's what is formally said of this system. The Queen decides who gets awarded them etc. newlinechar  newlinechar One recent UK example of controversy is [Jimmy Savile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile), who people think should have his knighthood stripped because of the paedophilia claims. Well, I think it's still claims. Not sure. It came to light once he died. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm afraid I can't think of any examples of it being forfeited after a crime, but it's gone 1am, I've been drinking, and it's now New Year's Day. So goodnight :P

I've said this before on reddit, but I just don't think abortion is the solution. It's a symptom of a broken system. Poor sex education and poor access to contraceptives cause teen pregnancy, which is still extremely taboo. Fear of judgement and being ostracized prevents young girls from seeking out wise counsel and being able to consider all the options. I feel like our current culture not only could do better in preventing unwanted pregnancy, but it also drives people to what is, in my opinion, an extreme measure (abortion).  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think anyone LIKES abortion. No one is out in the streets saying 'abortion is great!' No one wants to kill a fetus, that's why it's such a tough decision to make. I think most of us can agree that unwanted pregnancy is the ultimate, but fixable, problem to tackle here.
I didn't feel a foot!
I don't see electoralism as the way to fundamentally change the economic system. Modern political structures were built in service of the capital-owning class, and even a socialist government elected by majority would face severe governmental hurdles and plenty of opportunities for reaction. I think the role of socialist electoralism is to build a movement and for campaigns to serve as early platforms for the labor organizing and community mobilization that will eventually make the economic revolution. newlinechar  newlinechar I doubt Bernie Sanders will win the presidency in 2016. Massive surges by new parties have happened before, but I think it would require a bigger departure from established rhetoric than this 12-point plan. That's just to be the kind of paradigm-breaking movement that can inspire such a surge. It still won't happen if voters are too apathetic or too hostile to socialism. newlinechar  newlinechar If Sanders runs in a socialist party with genuinely socialist rhetoric, I'll support him. I don't think he'd win the presidency, but I don't think that should be the goal. The national campaign should be a platform for local elections, in which socialists could actually take control of city governments in presently Democrat-dominated districts. For example, Milwaukee has 38 years of history of socialist government and a mayoral election in 2016. Taking it back for socialists would be a big step for once again proving that socialist governance can get results. Combined with increased labor organizing and readying ourselves to fight reaction, we can actually advance the movement.

Although with that said, I would consider the points of some of the other responders there.  Every academic field is different, as well as their relationship to both businesses and the public. newlinechar  newlinechar I merely sought to point out that there will be no escape from personal politicking and backstabbing in the private sector.  Certainly there are good companies and good academia, but these problems are functions of (many) institutions, and frequently in a field with scarce job opportunities, one does not have the luxury to avoid being employed by those institutions, be they corporate or educational.   newlinechar  newlinechar In the end though, I strongly favor pursuing interests for your OWN interests.

It's generally considered a large gap ($26 extra in fees per 10k invested), but given that the industry average is ~1%, .46% is a pretty decent deal.

The main problem with your point is that it assumes you have a single card win condition. newlinechar  newlinechar For one, I think that if you have a deck with a single card you need to win, then you need to rethink your deck. Control decks tend to want to get most every card in the deck played at some point or another, but I wouldn't say there is any one card that causes you to win or lose, guaranteed. And aggro decks... newlinechar  newlinechar ...brings me to my second point. Fel Reaver isn't meant for control decks. It's meant for aggro decks. It's a 5 mana 8/8. It's for aggro. And in an aggro deck, you don't care much what gets burned. You just need to keep drawing stuff to play to win quickly. It does not matter what gets burned. Unless you run out of cards completely, then Fel Reaver didn't really have a drawback.
For sure, I was agreeing with you that he wasn't the Darren Woodson we came to know and love yet.

I have already explained that my sympathy for Jews does not in any way detract from my sympathy for other people who have also suffered tragedies.  We are talking about the interesting fact that Hans and Margret Rey, Jewish authors of the 'Curious George' books, managed to get out of Paris only hours before the Nazi occupation.  This remains an interesting historical event despite the fact that many millions of non-Jews also died in various ways as a result of WW II.  I can still care about Hans and Margret Rey and their narrow escape.  I also care about lots of other people in lots of other situations.  I am not the one who is obsessed with the ethnic categorization of people.  The main reason why I sympathize with Jews is because they are human beings.  All ethnic groups are part of the human race and they all matter for that very reason.  Some people, such as the Nazis or the neo-Nazis whom we still have in our world today, believe that the various ethnic groups must struggle for supremacy, but I personally believe that human beings of every ethnic group should work together to make a better world for all of us.  Life should not be construed as a zero sum game, in which for me to win, someone else has to lose.  It is much better if we all win.

I'm not completely serious, a blanket fix like that would cause more problems than it creates. but overall guardians have the more balanced of the scalings and whatnot that I'd actually like to see on most other classes, then guardians can be mostly 'redefined' to be much more utility based than so much damage.  It just seems if you're not doing damage you're literally not doing anything right now, and utility needs to be a larger factor in the game.
A fry up?
Literally...

Not a chance. Nappa can casually produce more damage than a nuke, fly at hypersonic speeds, survive blasts that destroyed the moon with only minor injury. Vegeta is two or three times more powerful. They have no notable weaknesses. Goku can metabolise poison and had never been ill before until he got the über-virus, it's fair to assume that earthly diseases and poison wouldn't work.
Well said, but at the same time not a reason to give up trying.
See for me this year was always supposed to be about The Witcher 3. The Witcher 2 for me is imo the best rpg since the year 2000.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'll be honest, I've not played Inquisition, I was not a fan of Dragon Age 1 or 2. Whilst not brilliant I am happy that the Final Fantasy XIII series has made its way to PC. newlinechar  newlinechar And Valkyria Chronicles is fantastic.
I don't mean to piss in your cheerios. We're all scratching our heads how to rebalance things. Because of the recent changes to the demo's pipes and loch'n'load I find myself spamming from medium to long ranges these days...and ultimately accomplishing nothing. newlinechar  newlinechar Choke points used to be awesome as you had opportunities to ambush people. Now you just get spammed out. The extra pipe for the loch gives the demo another opportunity to miss while dealing out massive damage.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you took one random rocket for 60 damage coming up to the corner. It'll only take 2 loch'n'load pills to kill you. Sure the demo's aim has to be solid, but if you're spinning and shooting your minigun, your movement is reduced and there's no way to keep up with the damage that even a mediocre demo outputs.  newlinechar  newlinechar To put it in simplest terms: Operating at 240 HP as a heavy is a disadvantage with his current minigun nerf.

I don't think anyone really likes abortion. There's no such thing, at least that I've come across, as a pro-abortion advocate. They are pro-choice advocates, and support a woman's right to choose to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.
I've been struggling with vulnerability for a few months now, partly thanks to my readings on gender and gender expectations. One interesting book I've found on the subject is [Daring greatly](http://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/1592407331/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1420073917&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=brene+brown+daring+greatly) by the wonderful Brene Brown. She has done a lot of research on shame and the trauma it causes, and the one thing she has found to work best against shame is vulnerability itself. She describes ways we can strive to be shame-resilient and to be vulnerable even as people ridicule us for it. If we want to make a change for men, I believe we will need to do it ourselves. For our own sake. In any case, I don't feel comfortable waiting on others to fix my life for me -- it may be a gender expectation of males, but I want to  feel empowered and in control. Women will change, but I'm not waiting.
She's a miserable fucking cunt and a waste of skin a burn victim could use.

I would say because it's very difficult to measure the impact of a charitable donation, it's also harder to say donating or not donating is worthy of either praise or blame. A child drowning on a beach is an immediate problem, and saving them is an immediate conclusion that cleanly solves the issue. Obviously, donations aren't like that. They may feed a child for a day, or help build a new water filter, but in what way is that measured? How successful will it be? Is it successful or helpful at all? Can it even be potentially harmful? How will those results be translated into a medium other people can understand, and if they are translated will they be impressive?  newlinechar  newlinechar The second difference has to do with circumstances. Although it may seem otherwise, a child drowning is not in the same type of peril as an Africn child starving, for example. The starving child's problems were brought around as a result of their surroundings and environment, both political and cultural. Starving in this sense is not a random act, like drowning, but a part of daily life. It's similar to the Joker's metaphor about no one losing sleep if thousands of soldiers are killed in battle, but if a terrorist kills an old woman on the street it's a national crisis.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would also disagree with you that anyone, including Bill Gates, is 'blameworthy' for not donating to charity. I would also say that someone on the beach who didn't help the children even if they had the capacity to is not in any way at fault or at blame for their drowning. Society might paint it that way, but the best way to look at the concept of blame is this: If the person in question didn't exist (say Bill Gates for example, or the swimmer) would the problem still occur exactly the same? If yes, that individual is in no way to blame or at fault. newlinechar  newlinechar Therefore the only thing someone can get from a donation is credit, no matter how much they give, regardless of numbers or percentages.  newlinechar

'The hammer coming down' on JD is none of his business--and, if he wanted to make it his business, he could just warn Tobi or other JD employees rather than taking the matter into his own hands.  And, given his behavior with the lies of omission in the allstar and how he reacted to being demodded, I have a real hard time believing that he did make an error in good faith.

I'd love to see more content but I'd doubt that it'll be from 4LS because of its 4chan-monkeys-with-typewriters origin. That hasn't stopped its members from writing individually though, as we've seen with the recent [Miki path script](http://www.reddit.com/r/katawashoujo/comments/2qb7pm/did_someone_say_miki_path/). Who knows, maybe some the main writers will or even have already moved on to new projects. The great news for us is that even if 4LS never reappears with another game, it seems likely that they'll be spiritual successors. One that I know to look out for is [Missing Stars](https://www.reddit.com/r/missingstars), which seems to be shaping up nicely and is even being supported by Mike Inel who'll create animations for it. Needless to say, I haven't given up hope :)

&gt; What is the point of that thought exercise if it has nothing to do with our situation? newlinechar  newlinechar 'Not a literal suggestion' doesn't mean 'nothing to do with the situation.' You're not familiar with [thought experiments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment)? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Have you noticed the price of oil lately? newlinechar  newlinechar It's still twice historical norms, and the drop in price over the last six months will very probably cut off production of the more expensive oil sources. That will give a better idea of the cheap oil production figures, which started declining in 2005. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; There has been a massive investment in alternatives over the last decade. newlinechar  newlinechar So much so that now solar and wind provide about 1% of total global energy production. Somewhat underwhelming. And even so, electricity generation is not a substitute for liquid hydrocarbons.
Heh, all good.  I'm shipping internationally, so I haven't received my gift yet, nor has my giftee received theirs from me.
I thank you for giving a clear, concise and well thought out reply. I completely disagree with you, but I respect your right to feel this way and I am appreciative of you sharing your views. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, an author could sell those books online. But can one person compete with a huge publisher that will fill every bookstore in the nation with those books? No. While the author may make some more money from his work selling it, it will likely pale to the potential millions that other's will make. newlinechar  newlinechar Could he be involved in the making of a movie? Sure, but it is just as likely that a film studio would either have little to do with him or nothing at all to do with him. newlinechar  newlinechar Does all this new exposure gain him new fans? Absolutely! Can he then cash in on that with future books? Sure. That is to say, he has ideas for  future works or can put them out at a reasonable rate. Remember, it took him 20 years to come up with and write his last book. Maybe he has another idea and can put something out right away. Maybe it takes him another decade. newlinechar  newlinechar Making art is not like fixing a car or digging a ditch. With those things you know exactly what you need to do, how to do it, what tools you need and how long it will take. Some people (like Stephen King) have a ton of ideas and can produce them quickly. Others can't and don't. It is a different type of endeavor and should be looked upon as such. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I think an artists should control the rights to their work while for the length of their lives. This will allow them to not only make money from them, but control how they are used. Take for example and artist who is opposed to their working being used in a TV commercial because they want it looked at as art, not as a marketing tool. They should have the right to say how it is used at least while they are alive. They shouldn't have to turn on the TV and see their work being used to sell a shoe or a brand of beer just because it has been 10 years since they created it.
But, even those places still have the rampant materialism that this man is commenting on.

I am amazed that this seems to be so poorly followed. I live in the UK and guns are pretty much non existent for most of the population. My dad taught me to shoot when I was younger and even though the only guns I ever owned were .22 air pistols or rifles it was the first thing he taught me and he also made sure it was enforced. I always assumed that in the states this would be like knowing the national anthem. Of course we usually only hear about these things when they are not following the rule. You never hear about the 1000,s of times people practice good gun safety.

Generally I turn down the extremely weird ones or totally unreasonable ones, just because they usually aren't paying a professional wage (or any wage).  Usually the weirdest jobs are character roles that an independent filmmaker or animator has created -- for instance, I just did the voice for a haunted house for a short film.  My character was a sentient, talking haunted house that basically was going senile, so it wanted to still be evil and cruel but it couldn't remember much anymore.  So, that was interesting.  That film hasn't been finished yet. newlinechar  newlinechar The strangest DIRECTION I've been given is another thing, though.  I had a client who was another independent director who wanted me to narrate his promo trailer video, and for one specific line, he told me all of the following: newlinechar  newlinechar Read it like you're a supervillain.  Read it like you're an evil cultist that is kind of maniacal and insane.  Read it like Mr. Rogers, but, like, almost like he's about to crack.  Read it like you're explaining your evil plan to James Bond.  Read it like you're Batman catching a criminal. newlinechar  newlinechar And I could go on.  Clients are usually weirder than the jobs are!

Yes totally!  It can be a very bad idea to start losing weight when you're not ready.   The ED will always take over,  and you'll never be satisfied.   You'll always want less and less,  and you'll obsess over every calorie.  When you are in that spot to begin losing, OP, (be patient with yourself please), keto is a great way to finish out recovery.  newlinechar  newlinechar On keto, my ED is becoming a very distant friend, even though I've been in recovery about 2 years. newlinechar  newlinechar To add to that, while losing weight you will still have reactive hunger days since recovery can linger for years.

I understand, but you have a great start here. It's better to add oneor two  things at a time, both for making sure the product suits you and also for getting to know the product group and getting used to thinking where it goes in your routine.  newlinechar  newlinechar And don't be afraid to modify for your needs either! For example, I used a gel the whole summer to seal my stuff in, but I got a different sunscreen and it balls up after my gel. So I've been using an emulsion-type moisturizer after the gel so the sunscreen spreads well. :)
&gt;Edit: and the mass would probably turn you into a black hole as well. newlinechar  newlinechar It actually wouldn't!  The Earth's Schwarzschild radius is about a centimeter (8.869 mm).  That means that you need an Earth-mass entirely contained within a sphere with a radius of about a centimeter for a black hole.  It doesn't have to start that way, but self-gravitation won't get you a black hole until you start talking about very massive stars (rather heavier than our own sun), so you'd have to have something else compressing it. newlinechar  newlinechar Meanwhile, a vanilla inventory full of osmium blocks is only a Titanic-mass (Schwarzschild radius: 7.7 \* 10^-20 m), and it is...oh, a player takes up more than one block, but not *all* of those blocks...we'll just call it a sphere a meter in diameter.  So that's about 19 orders of magnitude too large to form a black hole.  To get a Schwarzschild radius that large, you need about 3.4 \* 10^26 kg of mass.  In other words, you need 6.5 \* 10^18 such inventories in your inventory to become a black hole.  Even DSUs won't cut it here.

The number of people that I grew up with in which their parents didn't give a shit and they were just another write-off is fucking ridiculous. I've seen too many people with potential just kind of stop caring because their parents were shit and didn't really care about them. The entirety of the problem in the black community is that parents stop caring or never cared in the first place unless there is an opportunity for them to profit from their kids. And I don't know if it's intentional or if it's just what the kids feel when they only have a mom that has to work 2-3 jobs and doesn't have time for them but for a lot of the ones on welfare they also don't care about them. It's a tragedy. But even still that is no excuse to become a criminal and break the law. But I don't think that anyone is telling them this, the schools like to ignore this problem and the police just arrest them. There is no community support or sense of family.

Understanding the universe is important but it doesn't have value in and of itself. What good is understanding a world that we destroy? It's ignorant to say that by eating animals we give them a higher purpose. They exist as do we. They are conscious just like us. They don't exist just for our desires. We don't need to eat animals to maintain a healthy diet. Science is useful to understand the world around us but science is only the method of discovery, not giving meaning.

&gt;It's stated and shown to have all but totally neglected his training over the fifteen years between the Buu Saga and GT; stated repeatedly that he, Goten, and Trunks have been slacking off, newlinechar  newlinechar Good point.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; **to the point that Gohan is only now somewhat stronger in his base than Goten is as a Super Saiya-jin.**  newlinechar  newlinechar Proof of this? newlinechar  newlinechar 'Slacking off' doesn't indicate HOW MUCH weaker Ultimate Gohan got 15 years later, if he even got weaker. He received a *magical* power up, beyond physical potential, who is to say long periods of inactivity affect his power level? I want to see proof of this. Nor do we know just how strong GT SSj1 Goten is. If anything, Base Trunks in GT (and thus Base Goten, since the entire series implies they are roughly equal in power, even in GT where they **both** 'slacked off'),  at that point is roughly equal to what SSj2 Goku &amp; Vegeta were back in Z, since GT Base Trunks was able to **casually** one-shot kill Yakon, who took Goku SSJ2 to put down. In fact, one can argue GT Base Trunks killed Yakon even easier. newlinechar  newlinechar Based on this, and based on your statement that somehow GT Gohan is now as weak as GT Goten SSJ1 (Z's Goku SSJ2 x 50), that means GT Gohan is Z's Goku SSJ2 x 50. newlinechar  newlinechar That translates to GT Gohan = roughly Z's Goku SSJ3 x 12.5. newlinechar  newlinechar Sounds about right for Ultimate Gohan from Z anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar So I don't see how GT Gohan got weaker. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;And yet we see that Gohan is **seemingly evenly matched** with Rild (able to readily dodge Rild's attacks before Rild turned his arm into metal),  newlinechar  newlinechar Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoaaaaaaaaa newlinechar  newlinechar 'seemingly evenly matched?' newlinechar  newlinechar You literally made me crack up  newlinechar  newlinechar Please watch this: newlinechar  newlinechar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4jPVtzWTwU newlinechar  newlinechar Hey r/DBZ, who showed to be the CLEARLY superior one in that fight? newlinechar  newlinechar Gohan doesn't even land a damn hit, while Rhild is absolutely wrecking him. He was literally about to die until Majuub blindsided Rhild with an attack out of nowhere. Which brings me to my next point... newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;and that Rild was easily dispatched by someone no stronger than Evil Buu in terms of power (Uubuu) newlinechar  newlinechar Three things.  newlinechar  newlinechar One, Majuub in GT is eons ahead of Evil Boo. This is clearly evident when Uub vows to train as hard as he EVER did in order to spar Goku again in GT and win. So this is CLEAR indication that, IF Uub at the beginning was at Kid Boo's level from Z, he had past that level by an unknown amount, but **substantially** by the time he faces Baby. newlinechar  newlinechar Even more so when he merges with Mr. Boo. newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly, Rhild was caught majorly off-guard by that attack. He was in the middle of firing his finishing attack on Gohan when he was killed. newlinechar  newlinechar And lastly, that Rhild was fighting not on M2, where he is clearly VASTLY more powerful, but on EARTH. He had the entire M2 planet as an alley, which makes him a deadlier foe on M2 than on Earth. And he STILL wrecked Ultimate Gohan with relative ease. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, this isn't taking into account the later forms of Rhild who increases his already ridiculous base ki that's even larger than Boo's 50-FOLD (seemed to match Goku SSj1), probably even more. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So how exactly is Rild supposed to be far stronger than Gohan Buu when he was seemingly matched by someone that, at his utmost best, wasn't anywhere near Gohan Buu's strength (and who had been slacking for 15 years), and was destroyed effortlessly by someone far weaker than Gohan Buu? newlinechar  newlinechar Just in case anyone needs a refresher of what I just posted, Base/Ultimate Gohan in GT, based on vlorsutes here, is equal to GT Goten SSJ1, who is heavily implied to be equal to GT SSJ1 Trunks, who in just his BASE FORM is substantially stronger than Yakon, who took Goku SSJ2 from Z to kill, which would put GT Gohan, SSJ1 Goten &amp; SSJ1 Trunks all at a minimum of Goku SSJ2/Majin Vegeta x 50. newlinechar  newlinechar Or simply, Goku SSJ3 x 12.5. newlinechar  newlinechar About *roughly* what Ultimate Gohan looks to be in Z anyway, logically of course. newlinechar  newlinechar And BASE Rhild is several times stronger than that, which is clear that **BASE Rhild** even without M2 is at the very very least, stronger than Fat Boo, Mr. Boo, Super Boo, and Kid Boo. newlinechar  newlinechar NO doubt in my mind Rhild fused with Sigma Force and especally Meta Rhildo would RAPE both Z's Boohan and Z's Super Vegito newlinechar  newlinechar Which would make GT Base Goku superior to Fat Boo, Mr. Boo, Super Boo and *Kid Boo (duh)* newlinechar  newlinechar This is all of course speculation, albeit strongly backed up logically, so please try to disprove any of this.

Yes... it is her parents fault. But isn't the reason they were so strict and harsh with her because she told them she was trans? When I said 'keep apperances' I meant just play along with whatever they find acceptable until you can get the hell outta there.  newlinechar  newlinechar That's my point... why bother telling a super religious family something they will clearly be against? Save yourself the trouble... get thru high school (which is a pain in the ass for many teens), get to college or out on your own, and pursue what you want. You can be a trans female, hang out with others who accept you, and see a doctor to get that therapy if you want... all without worrying bout your parents.  newlinechar  newlinechar When you say 'circumvent puberty', you are talking about hormone therapy right? It's not as easy as saying you are trans and getting the therapy... from what I have read, you have to spend up to 2 years with a therapist and meet a bunch of criteria to qualify for hormone therapy. Especially at such a young age I feel a doctor will be hesistant to go thru with such a process without being sure its what they want.... not to mention you will prob need parental approval plus money.  newlinechar  newlinechar I just think kids who are going thru personal issues with sexual or gender identity issues should try and connect with friends and other likeminded people, but not necessarily their parents unless they know their parents are cool with it.

Not really to me.  I believe that she didn't believe Adnan did it at the time and might have accepted it since he was found guilty by a jury.  She didn't go to the trial, just the sentencing so, as many others, probably assumed the jury got it right.  Since the podcast and all of Jay's various versions of testimony have come to light, it wouldn't surprise me if she was back on the 'didn't do it' or 'unsure' train.  I would love to hear from her to know what she thinks now.  It is also interesting that there was an empty box with 'heart charm' on it found in Hae's car.  I would love to know if Jay gave Stephanie a heart charm bracelet for her birthday since we know he gave her a charm bracelet from his testimony at the time (even if he can't remember it now).

I would argue that the quality and album making ability from the Top Artists are a lot more consistent than UG. Kanye is Godly at production. Kendrick is one of the best lyricists of this generation. Drake is unparallelled at his ability to make Hooks and Bangers. All of these guys do a host of things well where UG artists might just be good in certain areas. There are some amazing lyricists who rap over garbage beats. There are some great producers who can't rap, or can't anyone decent on tracks. All of these guys do ever aspect of making rap songs well, and they do it consistently for multiple albums.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, in the age of the internet, mainstream is mainstream because its what most people fuck with.  This isn't the 90s where record companies have a monopoly on what everyone likes.  10 Years ago, artists like OF, Mac Miller, RTJ, Joey Bada$$, ASAP, FBZ, Chance, Kendrick would have never been as popular as they are now based one exposure. I think being a top artist now means more than ever because there is so much availability to get your stuff out there. If you have talent, make some good videos, and put out a couple good mixtapes/albums you can become a top artist.  newlinechar  newlinechar I honestly think that right now, the top artists are the top for the reason that the majority of people think they're talented people who put out great work, not some record company entertainment puppet.

That backup will last about 8 hours just powering the phone and nothing else, the batteries at the RT site will power the Alcatel-Lucent 7330 for about 48 hours which would should be long enough to get generators in place.  It's pretty amusing to see the customers of a 7330 after a power outage, if they have voice they'll show as online, but internet or internet/TV customers will all be offline.

No, I absolutely agree that informed consent to suicide is a real thing that ought to be respected. But in general, queer suicides are produced by a vicious culture that systematically denies queers their identities or right to exist. If the culture shifted, many of the queers who are pushed to suicide would not make that choice. And to ignore that nuanced difference is to excuse hetero-patriarchy and its violent ramifications.
It should be done by now :) I've added you.

I somewhat agree with this and somewhat don't.  From what i've read (Salumi: The Craft of Italian Dry Curing), Rhulman claims that wet brines are best for infusing flavour of your herbs/spices/whatever. newlinechar  newlinechar These days i typically keep my dry brines pretty simple, because if I'm attempting to infuse flavour i will use a wet brine.   newlinechar  newlinechar The main advantage of dry brines is that they are more effective at removing water mass.  So when you are making something that will dry cure, and you want to get lots of water out of it to start, dry brine is the way to go. newlinechar  newlinechar Also i often do both, especially with fish.  I will first dry brine to get a good cure.  Then i will wet brine to infuse some flavour. newlinechar  newlinechar But i do see your point about a wet brine diluting the maple syrup, which was my original point.  I do really like  /u/ebacklund's idea of using maple syrup concentrate.  But i would probably still do that with a dry brine.

Reading it back reminds me that we used to have issues with our sex drive not matching. I wanted sex every night, my wife didn't.

Interesting then, that the Soviets never paid them for it. No, this was a stupid move aimed at 'improving relations with the Soviets' newlinechar  newlinechar Keen to thaw Anglo-Soviet relations, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee invited Soviet scientists and engineers to the Rolls-Royce jet facility to learn how the superior British engines were made. Attlee further offered to license production to the USSR—after exacting a solemn promise that the engines would be utilized only for non-military purposes. The offer stunned the Americans, who protested loudly. And the Soviets? Russian aviation historian and Ukrainian native Ilya Grinberg says, “Stalin himself couldn’t believe it. He said, ‘Who in their right mind would sell anything like this to us?’ ” Grinberg, a professor of technology at the State University of New York at Buffalo, points out that the presence in the delegation of Artem Mikoyan himself—the “Mi” in MiG—should have been a tip-off to what in fact ensued: The Rolls-Royce samples shipped to the USSR in 1946 were promptly installed into MiG-15 prototypes and successfully flight-tested. By the time the fighter was ready for mass production, the Soviets had reverse-engineered the Nene; their copy was designated the Klimov RD-45. When the British objected to the violation of their licensing agreement, says Grinberg, “the Russians just told them ‘Look, we incorporated a few changes. Now it qualifies as our own original design.’ ” newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Read more: http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/the-jet-that-shocked-the-west-180947758/#CmObSEBQ0v0cDJUP.99 newlinechar Save 47% when you subscribe to Air &amp; Space magazine http://bit.ly/NaSX4X newlinechar Follow us: @AirSpaceMag on Twitter newlinechar  newlinechar From the very beginning the design was a sequence of compromises.

Thanks for being understanding— it's hard to convey what I'm trying to say over the internet without coming across as condescending, but I really don't mean it that way. It's not fair that victims of assault are forced to relive their painful memories time and time again when confronted with the ignorance of people who can't empathize with what it's like. But I'm trying to say is that through alienating those people, we are only hurting ourselves even more. To put it bluntly, every time a friend puts us down or doesn't take sensitivity to triggers seriously, the madman who caused our trauma has gained another victory. You're absolutely right that victims should never have to suffer because of the unintended ignorance of other people, and to stand up to this ignorance is certainly a righteous cause, but don't destroy yourself by giving everything up for the fight. Outsiders just don't understand what we've been through, and there's often just not much we can do to correct that ignorance without hurting our relationship with them. All I'm saying is be wise about how to handle issues like this. Sometime's it's not worth losing a friend over.

Well not exactly. In Tribes:Ascend I was quite a scrub imo playing for a half decent team that only made it to the quarter finals before getting demolished. Also, I have an idea for these tournaments as well that might work out very well. We did what was called a draft tournament in Tribes when the game was dying.  newlinechar  newlinechar Consisted of a bunch of players (low and high levels) signing up to a tournament. The high level players would captain lets say 8-10 teams and they would pick their teams pug style. The games we ended up having in this tournament were all very close and extremely entertaining games. Since the skill gap is so high between teams, players etc. This would give everyone a chance to play games against teams that are considerably balanced.

The tidal acceleration in LEO due to the Sun is about 5*10^-7 m/s^(2).  That comes out to about 3 mm/s of delta-v for one orbital period, or 1 m/s over 20 days.  The tidal acceleration due to the Moon is about 10^-6 m/s^(2).  The Earth's own equatorial bulge is the largest secondary orbital effect, but the pull of the Sun and Moon still matter over longer time periods.

&gt;Why do you have to keep living in a city where you have no friends and no job? newlinechar  newlinechar Because it's in a much safer and nicer place (Murca), and it's far away from my mother. The plan was always to move here as a family but then dad died and all the plans went strange, I ended up being the only one who moved. Like I said, long story. It's hard for me to consider to move back here because I have a bunch of stuff there, and it would basically be a downgrade. It took a lot of courage to move there at all, I was just 19. It'd be easier to get a car, a GED and a job than to move back. It's hard for me to be a self starter because of how my mother sat at the table with me to supervise me do homework and went into hysterics and hit on the table and threw shit if I did a mistake or complained etc. This was basically every day and most days I was in tears. I have associated doing work with being forced and treated like shit, so it's hard, but if I put the work in I don't need to move back. newlinechar  newlinechar I do have friends here, and it's actually the only reason why I accepted the invitation to come is to see them (including my best friend who is also visiting!), but I'm too shy to basically invite myself into their and their family's plans.

There's a pretty good documentary by Ken Burns called Prohibition on Netflix. Part one goes over how it came about pretty good. Women's groups used it as one of the first topics they openly discussed to gain political power. There were men's groups as well, of course, but much of the movement was powered by female only organizations.  newlinechar  newlinechar Part two goes through how ineffective it was and what the state tried to do to enforce it. It also covers the rise of organized crime through bootlegging and other illegal alcohol related activities.  newlinechar  newlinechar Part three covers the movement to repeal it. Largely based on the ineffective nature of the law, outcry against organized crime, and a need for more tax revenue.

That's a good option. :) Another would be giving the pronouns their own system of inflection, as in English. Pronouns are so fundamental to understanding in most languages that they often have special rules or irregularities to help set them apart and make them immediately recognizable. Even when English had a full case system, its pronouns were highly irregular, and now they're left as the only English weird with any case at all.

Personally I can see it. Wenger's been saying all season that Podolski hasn't yet reached match fitness since the World Cup, and Loew confirmed it when he showed up for Germany last intl break (seriously, who could not be fit enough to last 90 minutes against Gibraltar in a meaningless friendly). And now Wenger implying that he's not justifying his wages... basically, Podolski's starting to sound like Bendtner: figured he 'made it' at a young age, and that he can just coast for the rest of his career.

It's my understanding from my wife that clinical areas are almost exclusively nurse only. Because the hospital in House had a free clinic, it would seem that as a courtesy they may put doctors or possibly new resident (new doctors  fresh out of med school) there for learning purposes. I think in House's case, his clinic duty was a punishment due to his bad attitude, which is possible but probably really rare.

Had more to do with mountainous terrain, battle worthiness and supply thorough put than defensiveness. Germany built ever increasingly massive tanks when they were put on the defensive and even Japan built decent numbers of relatively heavier tanks for defense of the home islands.   newlinechar  newlinechar When you have to supply remote bases in China or far flung pacific islands, you need to have weapons that require little supply and are easy to maintain, hence the tiny Japanese battle lawnmowers.

Which is true. Those mother fuckers can take my money in an instant but it takes 48-72 hours to refund. True story, nextel (shut up, it was 2001), owed me $600 because their billing was fucked and debited my account 5 times in a 5 minute period instead of once. When I called they said 'amounts that large have to be refunded by corporate check. It will take 18-20 business days to reach you.' I escalated and basically said fuck that. When I owe you money you demand it right fucking now. You owe me money and want to take a month to pay it? Nope. I'll send that shit to collections. I had a check the next day fedexed overnight.

Yep, totally. I agree with all that. I think later I've started seeing more negative sides to it though, like what happens to *me* when I see someones in a bad mood, or when I notice someone in the group that isn't talking and I invite him to the conversation. Sure it feels good. And it feels good helping and supporting people, really. But I think it hurts to not get that back at ya in the same porportion. And it doesn't always feel as appreciated and might even go unnoticed. Where do I put all the effort? And for whom? I care about everyone but no one cares about me - sort of feeling.
I think its important to recognize that generally speaking, people are not going to risk arrest and engage in risky political mobilization if its not based in *some* kind of real, lived experience that is grounded in a reality.

The point of it is really to induce readers to question who is really accountable for the deaths created by anti-queer culture. I don't think the authors of this poster are aiming at indicting everyone who ever called their friend a fag for every queer suicide ever. It's a metaphorical device in one sense, but also a concrete account of who is responsible at the same time. People get hype about the word 'murder' (when people say Darren Wilson is a murderer, meat is murder, etc) but murder is a social construct. the legal system has a very narrow definition of murder. But the same way, in ecology there is point source (factory x pollutes the river) and non-point source (there are so many factories on this river we don't know who did it, if any one - more likely, many contributed) pollution, there seems to be a functional non-point source murder.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That doesn't mean that I don't care about queer teens.

You really think so? TCU isn't pulling in 4 and 5 stars out of the blue. Their current class has two four stars (one of whom Texas is going after) and twenty three stars. Their success has been built on developing lesser recruited athletes out of Texas - I mean, their star QB is a converted WR. And it's not like they haven't had success under Patterson before this season. They were one of the best teams from a non-automatic qualifying conference before they joined the Big 12 (part of the reason they got the invite in the first place). You never know what is going on behind the scenes but I don't think TCU is on the SMU path.

I do find it hilarious when a troll still tries their best even when it's clear that this particular person has seen through their bluff, as they say. Sometimes it even feels like an example of classic conditioning, where the troll has, learned that a particular set of actions lead to a favorable outcome in most situations and are unable to change how they act. In a couple of instances it's even been possible to fully predetermine how the troll in question is going to respond to a certain set of stimuli, and it is highly amusing.
Firstly, light years are a unit of distance, not time, secondly, to age well an album has to not sound dated after a longer period of time than 3 years, it should probably survive at least one MAJOR sound shift, or 'paradigm change' for lack of a better term, in the genre, and I don't see how that's the case with LiveLove yet newlinechar When it's been 7-10 years I might agree

I would say it's 50% location and 50% tide. Yes you could go drop a crab pot having never done so before and be successful. I have fished a lot in my life and this year I got into crabbing. Crabbing is beyond rewarding.  I just researched how to do it (crab trap with raw chicken as bait, 100-200 feet of lead core rope, a buoy with my name on it.) then started testing different areas around me. I have found a few favorite places to do so and found some horrible ones as well. Also tried a lot of bait. No joke, almost everytime I go crabbing I come back with my limit (5 per person male only) that's a lot of crab! I leave my traps for 45minutes to an hour. If it's successful we stay there. If not we move. 75-140 feet deep is about what seems to be best. In my short experience. Long answer sorry.

Any time you want to attempt something kickass, it's still 1D10, but you have to roll *over* your current number of drinks. newlinechar  newlinechar If you fail a non-combat roll (whether it involves kicking ass or not), you have to take a drink (lose bubblegum). When someone else succeeds in asskicking against you, take a drink (lose bubblegum). As you lose bubblegum, you're going to get *better* at kicking ass (because kicking ass requires you to roll *over* the number of drinks/bubblegum remaining), but worse at normal tasks. newlinechar  newlinechar When you're all out of bubblegum, you can do nothing other than kick ass (you have to roll *under* the number of drinks to do a non-ass-kicking related action, like pushing a button in an elevator, and when your number is zero, that's impossible). A normal doorknob is an unsolvable puzzle for you, but kicking that fucking door down is a piece of cake.

That's because the five year timeline was a marketing strategy to draw in new readers who would otherwise be intimidated by decades of canon history.

That depends entirely on how you're playing and what your goals are. Also whether you're counting in days or in turns. And what you count as 'finishing' the game. Basically, it's what you make it. newlinechar  newlinechar Speed ascenders can pull off 2- and 3-day runs. My shortest ascension was 5 days (that was pre-NS13, mind you) and my longest was 1,237 (there was a ~3 year hiatus where I wasn't playing in the middle). Right now I ascend about every 2-3 weeks -- school and a baby mean that I'm not playing every day anymore.  newlinechar  newlinechar In terms of turns spent, though, my runs are generally still in the 1,500-2,000 range, no matter how many days they take to play through.  newlinechar  newlinechar As to whether I've 'finished' the game on these ascensions, that also depends on how you count it. I haven't been spending a lot of time in aftercore lately, so there's lots of stuff that I'm not doing -- basement runs, the sea, etc. So I finish up in terms of killing the NS, freeing Ralph, and ascending -- but there's lots of content that I'm choosing not to access most of the time.

The whole trans guys having it easier on the dating front than trans girls I'm completely understand from my personal views. newlinechar  newlinechar If a year ago you asked me 'Gibslayer would you date a transgirl?' I'm sad to say but I would have probably replied with an answer when paraphrased was 'no, why would I date a man who thinks he's a girl?' newlinechar For which I apologize. newlinechar  newlinechar If you asked me that question 6 months ago you would have gotten an answer like 'ummeeahh umm aaaaa mmhh hmmm aaaa umm well idk I guess not' for which I apologize. newlinechar  newlinechar Now if you asked me the question I would hope it would be more of this answer 'yes. Under the right circumstances' by which if you expand I mean the same circumstances I would date a cisgender girl. Those being it feels right in comfortable with it, she is. And that we have a connection between us be that full on love or flirtatious. newlinechar  newlinechar Because that's the mindset change I feel I've gone though and hope I have. I feel I can see why guys have a kinda stupid view on it which is the whole stigma of dating a'man' if you were straight. I say 'man' but I mean women as that's what they are and I know that. But sadly I must admit there was a point I didn't mean women and there are to many men who are at that same point. For which I apologize. newlinechar  newlinechar From my experience women seem to be more understanding quicker when they have their views changed. newlinechar  newlinechar But yea that's my views on trans-people as its evolved over the year.

But even then, as we can see in The Hobbit it takes them a few days marching to reach them. By the time news came of the approaching army I dont believe they could have reached the Mountain in time.

No they aren't. If you talk about people like Sarrazin: If you say people from Turkey have *genetically* a lower average IQ there, then, yes, you absolutely might be called a Nazi. Rightfully so. newlinechar  newlinechar Germany doesn't even have an 'open immigration policy' in the first place, if you discount the EU. There's not even many voices to open it more, the little talk there is concerns highly-trained people. The exact people PEGIDA claims to have nothing against. newlinechar  newlinechar Not regarding immigration as such, but we also have currently way less asylum seekers here than during the Balkan wars. newlinechar  newlinechar Nah, this has other reasons. It's similar to Switzerland: Those areas with a *very low* percentage of people with migration background (such as Dresden itself) have the highest rates of xenophobia because people never met a Turk, at least not outside of the act of ordering a Döner, but still want to fear *something*. And our extreme right is good at exploiting latent fears, and doesn't mind useful idiots like the PEGIDA organisator, a wannabe criminal that was even too dumb to deal cocaine.

Just hose the rifles with CLP every couple hundred rounds. My buddy was ordered to do that if he didn't have time to clean the rifle. But even if he were to clean it, it takes 15 minutes tops to clean it thoroughly, so it's not like the time saving is a huge deal.  newlinechar  newlinechar All those new rifles work better with Pistons because they are designed around it. The AR is designed to be a DI gun, and it works best when it stays that way. In those trials, the MR556, which was the only piston AR, performed only marginally better than the M4. It was 200 some stoppages compared to 304 or something. It also costs over three times as much. The XM8 and the SCAR performed significantly better than both. Does the necessarily mean a piston is better? No. It just means they're better designed than the AR15, piston or not.

Yeah, I figured as much because those odds you mentioned earlier would be pretty darn awesome for guys here on DPP.
&gt; I would say because it's very difficult to measure the impact of a charitable donation newlinechar  newlinechar Well there are ways we can try.  For example, NGOs have figures for how much it cots to feed a person for X-amount of time, how much it costs to build a school, how much it costs to provide a reliable water source, and those sorts of things.  There are still potential issues with corruption, and things like that.  But if we imagine an ideal circumstance, where we knew that the money wasn't going to be stolen, or anything like that, then wouldn't we have a very easy way of measuring the impact of a donation?  It cost Y-amount to treat that person for their disease, and it cost Z-amount to feed that family, and so on.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; A child drowning on a beach is an immediate problem, and saving them is an immediate conclusion that cleanly solves the issue newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think that it should matter that the drowning children were located closer to you in space.  There could be people on the beach who were closer to the water than you.  Maybe you were sitting in a parking lot with binoculars, and had to run some distance to help them.  Why should it matter that you re located further away in space?   newlinechar  newlinechar Saying that there isn't an 'immediate conclusion' sounds more like an excuse than anything.  Maybe it's a harder problem to solve than 10 drowning people, but we still have a pretty good idea of what we need to do to solve the problem. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Obviously, donations aren't like that. They may feed a child for a day, or help build a new water filter, but in what way is that measured?  newlinechar  newlinechar We know how much it costs to feed someone for X-period of time.  The amount of wealth possessed by billionaires is more than enough to feed everyone for more than a day.  We could actually count the number of people who are being fed, for example.  That would constitute a measurement.  Regardless of how you want to measure it, we can clearly observe the degree of good being done by contributions of various dollar amounts. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The starving child's problems were brought around as a result of their surroundings and environment, both political and cultural. Starving in this sense is not a random act, like drowning, but a part of daily life. ... I would also say that someone on the beach who didn't help the children even if they had the capacity to is not in any way at fault or at blame for their drowning. Society might paint it that way, but the best way to look at the concept of blame is this: If the person in question didn't exist (say Bill Gates for example, or the swimmer) would the problem still occur exactly the same? If yes, that individual is in no way to blame or at fault. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't mean to suggest that the individual is blameworthy because their actions caused the person to drown or die.  Obviously, our hypothetical people would die just as soon whether or not there is some person around to choose to not save them.  They are blameworthy because they chose to not save the person.   newlinechar  newlinechar

Gabe's a patient in a mental hospital. His 'blanket' is a straight jacket. His room is solitary confinement. Most everything else was fabricated by his degrading mind.

If I recall correctly, he recommends around 20% of net worth invested in real estate- 80% of assets in real estate is quite risky.  Keep in mind, *all* investments are tantamount to gambling including real estate. I'd recommend they diversify and talk to someone about minimizing taxes before they do anything.   newlinechar  newlinechar On another note, real estate is a largely illiquid asset.  If they need eg 100K for emergency medical bills, they can't just go sell a house.  
Why do you say that?  He didn't say 'all terrain parks have air bags' he said many.  He's not lying.  There's eight in my state alone that have them and we are far from a winter destination area/climate.

He made the unison blast beat a thing, as well as many brutal death tropes like the 3/4 grooving breakdowns and such. It's kind of ignorant, IMO, to call him stock when he is part of the makeup of that stock.

I knew about these but I never found them advantageous enough when you compare it with other weapons you'll have available. Not to mention they require the specific use of your active ability, which restricts you from using it as you normally would. Maybe I just haven't tried enough, but I personally haven't really found it to be worth it.
I didn't  serve under him at all, but I did see him in a chowhall in Ramadi and he left all of the officers to sit with the Junior Marines and just shoot the shit. He was completely laid back, and I immediately liked him because he seemed sincere. That's  not to say that he was, but why he gained my admiration.
Yup... unfortunately this is totally accurate. I mean the only westerner I can think of who really 'made' it in recent history was the guy who wrote NGNL. But that was a light novel, he was part Japanese, and his wife was Japanese and helped him on it. And I mean, he even changed his name to sound more Japanese. newlinechar  newlinechar I think a more 'realistic' (if you could even call it that) goal for a non-Japanese is just getting serialized period... Aiming for Jump specifically is even extremely hard for regular Japanese mangaka. This isn't like those stories in Jump where if you try hard enough, you'll overcome the obstacle and somehow make it in the end.  newlinechar  newlinechar But anyways, I hope you are able to get out your work somehow... Maybe aiming to join a circle even?

A GBA Sounds item could be in the code (There are a lot of unused items in previous games in the code IIRC). I'm very hopeful for DLC since Nintendo as of late has been started rolling it out, but Ohmori has said in the past he didn't think DLC fit Pokémon so you're probably right.

I guarantee 90% of the 'crime' is nonviolent petty shit. They shouldn't even be arresting people if the 'crime' is victimless. When I was in the county jail for a month, out of 40 people maybe 1 was in for a crime that involved a victim.

Can you explain how 3% increased damage and 6% dual pen is the difference between being useful late and not? I mean you make it to be if you go 14/2/14 then you can't even 1v1 the support. newlinechar  newlinechar S3 was heavily about the early game, but jungles could go 21/9 because of leasing and the general weakness of the jungle. S4 jungle was about mid-to-late game teamfights and early game didn't matter as much as S3. Now, early game is super important due to dragon buff, so being healthy early to snowball lanes (believe it or not, getting flash blown is a huge swing in lane) allows you immense pressure the 21/9 jungle who took 1-2 minutes longer to clear will not get.

Oh dear, that's too bad.  It's a bummer because when I said above that I could relate to it, it was true - Initial D was a chunk of my high school years, except that that was way before Initial D.  Back in the very early 80's I worked at a mall theater and we stayed open for midnight movies on weekends.  All my car buddies from high school would turn up and we'd use the mall parking lot as a racetrack after-hours, at 2am and beyond.  This was before the days of constant video surveillance everywhere, I should add.  We basically had a whole private racetrack to ourselves and had a blast jockeying for bragging rights around the 'loop'.   newlinechar  newlinechar The first time I sat down to watch Initial D, despite my being near 50 years old now, it was like, 'Yep, I know all these guys.'

I dont disagree about Harvin, but i think he just isnt a standard WR and thats why he isnt used a lot past the LOS in the traditional 'run a route, catch the ball, get YAC' way.  newlinechar  newlinechar Lol why dont they count? They were penalties that had no effect on the play at the time. Its one thing if you count say a RB TD run that had a penalty and that penalty is what resulted in the huge running lane the RB ran through...but the penalties called on Harvin's TD's had nothing to do with the play in regards to Harvin.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think we have restrictions that he is trying to make up for by doing odd stuff. We have had red zone issues and scoring TD's in the end zone issues, we dont have Miller to dump off a TE TD to or a Sidney Rice to sling a jump ball to or a Golden Tate to gun sling a slant pass for a TD too...so i think we have seen some weird stuff cause of that.  newlinechar  newlinechar My overall point is there is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much we dont know, that the staff (coaches, coordinators, etc) do know. And what we do know is that we win...and we win a lot...and we got the #1 seed two years in a row, and our Offense with a patched O-line and no #1 WR has gotten it done.

With mine, I put the little potty by the big potty.  Whenever I went, I encouraged them to sit too, fully clothed to start.  As they became comfortable I would take off their diaper.  My first was scared of the big potty, my second preferred the big potty.  So I just followed their lead.  If there was a melt down, I didn't push them.  I didn't want to make it stressful.

Yes. To add one reason to both parts of your argument: newlinechar  newlinechar In addition to being different, Jews have also been more wealthy. This isn't because of 'loljewishgreedy' but rather because Christians forbade themselves from loaning money and working with gems, which left Jewish populations to reap those windfalls. Governments would realize an opportunity to grab fast cash, expel the Jews, and take their shit. In many cases, rinse and repeat. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, Hitler hated Jews not only because they were a convenient scapegoat but also because they ran the art school that he was rejected from.

&gt; If you read the article the British government offered citizenship for those who were willingly to help Britain and other coalition forces (Britiain wasn't just the only one). newlinechar  newlinechar Well, it had some caveats. They had to be employed for 12 months they had to do this and they had to do that and it only applied for those who worked all the time in Helman and so on. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Now, it's about time we come up on our promises (doesn't matter on which country) and offered citizenship to those who risked their lives and their family lives in during their jobs. Their jobs have ensured the safety and protection for many soldiers who fought in Afghanistan. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, they are quite the suckers. If they can be exploited that easily for a cause that goes against their interests (joining in a occupation of your own country) then they can blame themselves. If some country occupied ours and some asshole joined up with the occupiers and helped them, then the only TRUE justice should be left to the people after the occupiers have left. newlinechar  newlinechar Why on earth should WE take in people who so willingly would be treacherous against their own kind? Those people can't be trusted, let them be there. They did their jobs and they already cashed in their last paycheck. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Now, doesn't it seem unfair that those who helped out our soldiers in need are now needing our help, yet they have to fight for what was promise? newlinechar  newlinechar The Afghan war is not about fairness. It's not fair that some farmer in Afghanistan that have no idea where Britain even is and just want to tend his farm gets blown his legs off. And it's not fair that we killed his children either, but that is what happens when we start wars. It is supposed to be unfair, so they know that next time they better be a liberal democracy or we will kill them again.

I warn you, it can be incredibly difficult.
&gt; In the current US political climate, it is not possible to champion a purely socialist platform and be elected to office, let alone the presidency. Even Bernie's beliefs, should he decide to run for President, would be spun by FOX using graphics from the Red Scare from dawn till dusk.  newlinechar  newlinechar Hence, I take the social anarchist position of: fuck the presidency. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The only way you create such a shift in opinions towards socialism is through a cultural paradigm shift over a number of years. The abolishing of slavery did very little to shift public opinion of blacks, but as time went on, the culture came to view blacks as humans too, and recognised the evils of slavery. The same thing happened with gun control in Australia: regulations were put into place despite strong opposition, and gradual acceptance of those regulations created a climate where it would now be politically lethal to run against it. We changed how the system worked, and people gradually learned to accept it. newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, so it turns out that if you change something quickly and radically, the public consensus eventually supports it? Interesting; we far leftists have a word for that: revolution. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Whether you agree with Bernie wholeheartedly or don't think he goes far enough, the fact remains that he is the best option for any socialist to support, because he is the only one capable of bringing that cultural paradigm shift that would cause people to warm to socialism. newlinechar  newlinechar Uh... no. It was this practical point that eventually attracted me to anarchism: new archons are *very willing* to capitulate with present archons because, above all, they seek concentrations of power. And once the new guard settles, it, along with the old guard, will feel uncomfortable with any change whatsoever, because, after all, they don't want to lose all that power they got beforehand. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Once people get a taste of a universal healthcare system, of a $15 minimum wage, and of a properly functioning education system, they will come to see socialism without hostility. It wouldn't be unreasonable then, to make that culture that Bernie could help create, a stepping stone to an even further leftist government. newlinechar  newlinechar Or, as we've seen play out [over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Economic_Policy), and [over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic) and over ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War#Republicans_2), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_Days)) again, regimes that are completely out of touch with popular needs.

If I had to guess, its because of something to do with flavor-ants being added after the brewing processes, instead of being part of the brewing process.  I bet most of the fancy flavors in these aren't part of the actual brewing processes, and are blended in after the fact.   Therefor its not 'hipster beer purist' approved. newlinechar  newlinechar Or something like that.  I'm totally talking out of my ass, I could be totally wrong.  Whatever.  Either way, Rogue is a good brewery and I will gladly drink one of these fancy pink ones any day.  newlinechar  newlinechar I found these to be very subtle, not overpowering, and still very much 'Beer' tasting, NOT 'Beer with flavors added' tasting.   They sound really over the top, or like they might even be gross, but every pink Rogue I have tried was good. 
Okay. Ready? newlinechar  newlinechar __ newlinechar  newlinechar There you go. The reason I did that is because there is no such statement in the Talmud.  this statement does appear in a commentary to that page of the Talmud called, 'Tosafot,' which was written about 700 years ago. It also appears in a Halachic Midrash called the 'Mechilta.' Let us quote the statement precisely, however, along with its entire context. In Exodus 10:7 it says, 'And Pharoah took his six hundred best chariots and all of the chariots of Egypt and pursued the Children of Israel.' Asks the Mechilta, 'But from where did the Egyptians get horses to drive the chariots, didn't all the Egyptian livestock perish? (in the plagues of pestilence and hail) as it is written (Exodus 9:6) 'and all the Egyptian livestock died'? The Mechilta responds that they must have belonged to those Egyptians that 'feared G-d,' as it says in Exodus 9:20, 'He who feared G-d among Pharoahs subjects brought his servants and livestock inside their homes.' The Mechilta continues, therefore 'the best of Egyptians, kill.' Egyptians not Gentiles; 3,300 years ago, not now. For it was those good 'G-d fearing' Egyptians that gave chase (or at least lent their horses to give chase) to the Children of Israel with murderous intent. There is another version that reads, 'The best of the Canaanites, kill.' But again, the Children of Israel were at war with the Canaanites. The Mechilta is describing a wartime policy of not sparing even the seemingly good of the enemy for otherwise you may fall into their hands. This is also the way the Tosafot commentary to Avodah Zarah 26b explains this statement; that it refers only to times of war.

New 3/8' twisted nylon has a [breaking strength of around 1.5 tons and a working limit of a little less than 300 lbs](http://www.bevisrope.com/rope-info/rope-characteristics#nylon_twisted_rope).

That's a lot of mail-in rebates you have to keep track of. It's ok for what it is, though my build is obviously more powerful. newlinechar  newlinechar The mail-in rebates for the RAM seem to be incorrectly flagged there. From what I can tell on Newegg, you will not get individual $20 off for each of those two sticks. Instead, it looks like you get a grand total of $20 for everything, if you buy both sticks together as a combo. The two RAM sticks come out to $83.98, and then you have to send out the mail-in rebate to get $20 back, bringing the total to $63.98. This comes out to only $2 less than the RAM I suggested, and without being hassled to print out your receipt or mail anything in. Also, this RAM is clocked lower, so it's worse.

Yes, 0.7% is actually a huge difference, when compounded over decades.

I believe type errors like those that are reported to the user are detected in the type inference engine's stage(while the compiler is still dealing with the haskell source code's AST). There's more detail here: http://www.aosabook.org/en/ghc.html newlinechar  newlinechar They don't say it quite explicitly but it seems evident: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;    On the whole, the type-check-before-desugar design choice has turned out to be a big win. Yes, it adds lines of code to the type checker, but they are simple lines. It avoids giving two conflicting roles to the same data type, and makes the type inference engine less complex, and easier to modify. Moreover, GHC's type error messages are pretty good. newlinechar  newlinechar From the section titled, 'Type Checking the Source Language' newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: formatting

The biggest offender of this is the Assassins Creed series in my opinion. I 100 percented Black Flag and I will never buy another game in that series again. I don't even really try 100 percent games anymore. It's a good way to make yourself hate the game if the achievements are too monotonous.
He said it's because the Source Engine doesn't have motionblur, so he simulates it by playing the game at a higher FPS in slowmotion letting him capture more frames to be used for motionblur. At least that's what I understood, I could be wrong.

Good luck and happy clashing!  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Alright, well obviously you're the one with the base and if it works for you, that's fine. I'll try to speak for a potential attacker.  newlinechar  newlinechar In my mind, the most pressing issue is that exposed AD. If I was rocking giant + healer, your base would be the perfect thing I'm looking for. Take out the AD, lay down the healer, and put it on cruise control. Those air mines won't take out a healer. Your springs are in a great place, and that will probably save you, but if I can take out enough of your defenses before my giants die, it won't matter.  newlinechar  newlinechar If that were my base? I would put the AD behind walls right where the giant bomb is. And then move the giant bomb behind one of the builder huts. The one closest to the edge is probably where I would barch from, but if you aren't taking much fire from there, put it where it's needed. I can't imagine any troop taking out that AD to head up to its current placement. They should go off to the side cannons. If you're using it as anti-WB, I would seriously reconsider. newlinechar  newlinechar I wasn't suggesting that you move your spring traps, but rather put a wall on the on the other side to absolutely force them through.

I've played through it with one romancing her with a living hero of fereldan, one with a dead one, one where she wasn't romanced and one in which she was killed by the hero of fereldan.

They want to talk about it, want to imagine it, want to hear other people describe it (as long as they make it sexy enough and don't let real life intrude too much) and want to watch it, but present them with the reality of a relationship involving scat (or whatever kink they happen to be into) and most seem to lose interest completely.

Ok so I will do my best to explain the motive. newlinechar  newlinechar [Massive Umineko Spoilers] (#s 'So I'm assuming you already have read about the fact that Shannon, Kanon, and Beatrice are all Yasu. Yasu's motives are complicated, there are a lot of factors going in. First of all there is revenge. She was raised as a servant and treated quite poorly for most of her life. Even though she got along well with the kids many of the adults and other servants can be fairly abusive. But that's not the true motive, it's more of why she did not really mind killing everyone.') newlinechar  newlinechar [Continued massive spoilers] (#s 'One of the biggest issues for Yasu was the fact that he/she was in love with not one, but three of his/her cousins/nieces/nephews. While I'm at it there is the sudden shock of realizing she is a product of incest and is related to all the people she loved. Episode 6 did a good job of illustrating Yasu's internal struggle. Only one of her personas could have a truly fulfilled relationship. She was in a three way deadlock struggle for permanent control of her body. As Will states in episode 7 if Battler had arrived a year later or earlier the incident would not have occurred. If he had shown up a year later Shannon and George would already be married. Kanon and Beatrice would have lost and would no longer exist. After all the losers souls are absorbed to make the winner a complete human, a very fitting metaphor given in episode 6. A year earlier and Jessica and Kanon's relationship would not have really taken root yet. As stated in episode 6 a one on one duel is much easier to deal with, it's a straight fight. But since Battler arrived the same year George was proposing, and the same year that Kanon attended the school festival with Jessica, there was a deadlock.') newlinechar  newlinechar [still massive spoilers] (#s 'So Beatrice comes up with a plan, a last ditch effort.

The murder serve two main purposes. The first is motivation. The carrot and the stick. The gold and the headship are the reward, and the murders are the punishment. The second purpose is revenge. As I mentioned early on Yasu has many reasons to hold grudges against the majority of the family. Whether it is Krauss and Natsuhi's abuse, Eva's cruelty towards Shannon, Rudolph and Kyrie's role in Battler leaving, or Rosa's extremely abusive and neglectful treatment of Maria (who is Beato's closest friend). Yasu has a number of psychological issues from gender issues, self esteem issues, multiple personality issues, issues of her parentage, etc. She/he is extremely confused, psychologically hurt, and backed into a corner by her three way internal struggle.')

And those things he did those fights that he lost were not things that he did in the prime of his career in pride.

Yes definitely; One of the hardest things about learning this stuff is just the enormous scope of info that's out there, and picking out what's relevant.

That's what happened with Murphy. (TW) newlinechar  newlinechar When my stepfather beat me the last time, Murphy (a shelter dog I had adopted years back broke through my bedroom door and started to try to fend my stepfather off. Murphy weighed about 110lbs (Lab/Dalmation mix) and was biting him similar to the way a police trained german shepherd attacks what it is pointed toward. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, my stepfather weighs 320 and is built and wasn't a match for Murphy or me.  newlinechar  newlinechar We got him out of the house and I took Murphy to my grandparents where I was going to stay until I knew he was in jail. Late one night, I hear Murphy barking and I figure he sees the tractors because there is always lights running up and down the field. newlinechar  newlinechar I wake up to check on Murphy and he was dead. His neck was snapped, marks that looked like stabbings but couldn't be disregarded as tooth marks and his snout was gone, hanging by a little piece of tissue. Those were the vet findings. newlinechar  newlinechar So you can tell my apprehension about training a dog. I just need someone and my therapist brought it up. My stepfather is out on probation right now and the protective order is still in place until he violates his probation. He has had no contact with us (me and my mom) and we gave up the house and moved where he wouldn't know, but via public record I am able to keep an eye on his addresses and such. newlinechar  newlinechar Right now I'm staying in a hotel because my mom is in the hospital and every movement, every door slam, every creak, every knock sends me into anxiety overdrive.

Yep, being a guy is just your identity - it's a thing you know inside yourself that is the sum total of many different factors and you don't have to justify or explain it to anyone.

His point is that the gun-camera would zoom into something that you weren't looking at and takes over your entire field of view, it's very disorienting and it would probably make you puke all over the inside of your helmet, imagine suddenly seeing out of your fingertips instead of your eyes.

Yeah, all that said, though, I don't think studio intervention is always terrible. I checked out the deleted scenes for both Amazing Spider-Man movies on YouTube, and thought they were all awful. I really do not give a shit about the Peter's parents subplots in the new movies, and the deleted scene with the dad standing at Gwen's grave for ASM2 was laughable (I really like the montage in the theatrical release, this would have completely undercut all that for me).

The Chris Jones flop was only reviewed because he acted like he took an elbow in the face and the refs get to review that to see if either a flagrant 1 or 2 should be called.

Nxd7, Qxd7 comes Qxe2 - so Bg4 is necessary. The evaluation +4 is only given because Bg4 wins a piece, any other move would probably make the position better for black. I didn't mean to say that all you did was put the position into an engine, I meant it in the way that giving +4 evaluation as a clarification has no meaning without the corresponding move(s). 
Oh, yeah. I never had to do that lol. Guess I just never had to use it, especially in my physics classes.

It's a fallacy built on fragile egos.  It would be easy to believe this, for anyone who has been rejected.  Bad boys turn into bad men and make up quite a few domestic violence cases.

No. It has to be 'expanded.' The word 'embiggened' is triggering in many ways. People who never grew or attained a sufficiently-satisfying physical height will never be 'big' and thus are triggered by that word. People of size may be triggered because it contains the three-letter combination 'big.' People of all genders and kin-types who have penises that are not considered average size or better will be triggered by the word 'embiggened.' Because theirs aren't.

&gt; but your rant was rather pointless as it didn't have anything to do with the discussion. newlinechar  newlinechar He claims property rights mean you can't carry at work, I disagree.  Not sure how that doesn't have to do with the discussion. newlinechar  newlinechar You disagree, that's cool.  But if /u/Equatorfishhat can have three paragraphs on the rights of property and the ethics of carrying at work then my response to why I disagree is as on topic as his.  Fact is OPs desire is legal in GA.  They can fire him with cause if caught, he knows this.  I didn't start the ethical debate nor did OP, I'm just giving a counterpoint. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;How do they not? newlinechar  newlinechar For the reasons I explained.  My rights to privacy in my person and self defense are greater than the property rights of someone else. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; it's a matter of 'my property, my rules. If you don't like it, get the fuck out'. newlinechar  newlinechar Ah, so I should be allowed to whatever I want to you if you come on my property, just as long as you see a piece of paper first?  Clearly there are limits to the reach of property rights.  I can't put a 'trespassers will be shot' sign and that have actual force of law nor would it be ethical.  I say carrying a firearm is on the same side of fence (so to speak). newlinechar  newlinechar I live in Florida, so on the rare occasion I notice a no guns sign, I willfully ignore it.  We have statutes that say where I can carry, I don't care what a business says.  They want to ask me to leave, they're free to do so, and I'll leave.   newlinechar  newlinechar The right to ask me to leave is a lot like the powers of government to limit speech.  No prior constraint.  They have to do it after the act, not before. newlinechar  newlinechar Note also that there is a long standing tradition (legal and moral) of treating residences, work places, and places of public accommodation (stores) by different standards in both the rights of property owners and those others on the property.  This 'my property my rules' idea doesn't exist in the real world.  You cannot for instance create an unsafe work environment by ignoring building standards.  That's what a no firearms policy is, an unsafe work environment. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Not trying to be a dick newlinechar  newlinechar Nah, it's cool.  We're all just stating our opinions and debating.  That's what reddit and /r/ccw are for. newlinechar  newlinechar Quick edit, when you say: newlinechar &gt;He never said that they did. newlinechar  newlinechar In response to my 'Property rights do not supersede other rights' you do see that I'm replying to someone that says 'if you want your rights respected, you have to respect those of others. That includes property rights. If your employer says that you can't have a gun at work, you can't have a gun at work.'  I don't know how to take that but that property rights are superseding my natural and protected right to keep and bear arms.

I would be curious to know if Moorcock is still as anti-Tolkein as he was back when he wrote 'Epic Pooh.'

I read some Elric stories a long time ago and I'm pretty sure I read the first volume of the Eternal Champion saga (waaaaaaaaay back when White Wolf was publishing them).  I thought they were okay, but they didn't stick with me (they seemed pretty standard issue pulp sword and sorcery).  Wizardry and Wild Romance (his nonfiction book in which 'Epic Pooh' appears) is interesting, but does anyone have recommendations for fiction -- short stories maybe?  If he's so radical, I'd like to read something... radical.

'Oh NOOOO!' said Cow. It was horrible: her beautiful Rose Bowl picnic was being torn apart in front of her eyes! Not a cloud in the sky and yet here was this sudden vortex of wind, strong enough to lift her EZ-UPs 50 feet into the turbid air!

if it wasn't for mcfc you wouldn't have a club though? City are one of the best teams in football on the planet and you don't care about your team being owned by city?

No, dear Sir or Madam on benefits, Asylum seekers actually don't get more money than you do, they get a hundred bucks less and on top of it aren't guaranteed money in the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar There's also a huge current of conspiratard-like distrust against *any* press in there, *even the right-wing press*.

For those who remember those dates better it is a better way of providing a chronology.  For those who remember the interconnections, discussing the bigger picture is better.  I think it is good to try for both.  Both have a chance of sticking and provide another angle to remember significance.  I remember some dates precisely but more often I remember their magnitude: like was it closer to 400 or 100?  14 years later I am still ok at narrowing down chronology for many events with the help of dates and context for many occurrences in history.   newlinechar  newlinechar Oh and facts are important because they are data points.

An interesting aside: it is reasonable to suggest that ectomycorrhizae are facultative saprotrophs, meaning they decompose organic matter for carbon when they have been disconnected from their host, a common result of any kind of disturbance occurring in the forest floor. One might expect some form of saprotrophism to be necessary for ectomycorrhizal survival in these instances. However, several studies have demonstrated that the carbon within ectomycorrhizal mycelium is not derived from organic matter, but rather from recent photosynthate (host-provided carbon). Regardless, there is evidence that ectomycorrhizae transform organic matter in the soil, but what exactly are they doing with it?  newlinechar  newlinechar Turns out they are doing something called 'co-metabolism', -- using host-provided carbon (simple sugars from plants) as a fuel to decompose organic matter for its complexed nitrogen, not for its carbon. In this way, they hold up their end of the symbiosis and by foraging for nitrogen, some of which makes it back to the host. Well, what about all that carbon that they've presumably tossed aside while they are mining for organic nitrogen? Its fate is unclear; is it lost as CO2? Transformed into more complex organic matter and stored in the soil? Or perhaps it is scavenged by the real decomposers - the free-living saprotrophs.  newlinechar  newlinechar A recent [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3qhC4EVAf0Xc3gzd2h1RzRkdm8/view?usp=sharing) on this very topic provides further insight.  newlinechar  newlinechar Ok I'm done.

The Satan of Christianity is really just a crossover between the Jewish notion of the Angel/adversary and the various pagan notions of evil avatars that came from the same cultural pool of colloquial religious notions as the several references to Hades in the original Greek of some books of the New Testament. They weren't referring to the pagan deity, or even specifically to the pagan underworld, but to those more generic notions that become ingrained in a culture by its religions.
That's right, he was just fighting for his grazing rights, not trying to overthrow anything. What forced the BLM to [back down](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundy_standoff) was the potential PR nightmare of having to deal with armed militias. In states where there are well-protected open carry laws, those who open carry typically aren't hassled by cops because there's a visual reminder that the otherwise law-abiding citizens are armed. So the common denominator is that when faced with a potentially violent conflict, only a visual show of force prompts the government to consider backing down for fear of negative PR or worse. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, armed resistance [doesn't always end](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_siege) in de-escalation. But without the Waco, TX siege, Bundy and his supporters could have paid the ultimate price for their armed resistance. The Feds don't want another Waco, if they can help it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar So now I suggest that those Occupy kids follow suit because it either ends poorly for them (another Waco massacre) or they force the government to back down and fight a different way. They can go join Mike Brown or they can take a lesson from the Bundy standoff and learn what motivates The Man to de-escalate the situation. Either outcome would be fascinating to observe. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Even now with the two NYPD cop killings, [arrests are down](http://www.alternet.org/nypd-work-stoppage-results-arrest-rate-plummet) as the department changes its policing strategy. I don't laud the killings--no one here does--but it has produced *some kind of change*, at least in the short term. It's just regrettable that it could only come about through violence.

I believe its an order of libertarian priorities we should savor the small victories and continue to push for lager battles. The battle for smaller government and thus less cops now essentially occupying non-performing jobs is a separate larger battle than the smaller although welcome 66% reduction in everyday interaction with the jackboots for petty crimes that, as the article states, should be decriminalized. This is also an example of a separate longer larger battle. 
Ok I'll give it a shot.  Easiest way is advanced Google searches, see the right sidebar. newlinechar  newlinechar Now for a different method: you can portscan IP ranges, on port 80 (or 21 for ftp, 443 for https), with a script that gets the website title, then grep the scan to look for 'Index of /' or something similar.  You could even write a script to spider those sites with an 'index of blah' and then look through the output for files or extensions.  With a little bit of practice you could get more advanced, like maybe script for looking in wp-content or whatever Wordpress uses. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, all this should only be used in theory, and it might be illegal.

I work on an online service. newlinechar  newlinechar The analogy he's given is largely accurate. Each server takes some time to process any given request. Because there's a finite amount of servers, if the users accessing the page far exceed the capacity, they will essentially just wait in line for their turn to get processed (this line is called a queue). Most of the time, your browser will eventually give up if the page doesn't load. newlinechar  newlinechar Additionally, most server software has a maximum length of the queue which is allowed. If additional requests come in and the queue is beyond this maximum, it will simply turn them away (or just not respond). This protects the service - if the queue wait times become very long, by the time the server has answered your request, your browser will have already given up. Thus all of the work the server is doing ends up being useless, because by the time the request is processed, the user has gone away. This is why you'll see services like imgur and reddit show a message that they are overloaded, rather than just waiting for the request to finish. newlinechar  newlinechar Some additional factors can be important. When the server is heavily loaded, it may actually get *slower* at processing each individual request. This can be due to a variety of things, but mostly because a lot of processing resources are used queuing up the new requests coming in. If the memory used by a process (like the webserver) exceeds the actual capacity of the server, it will get 'paged' to disk (temporarily moved to the hard drive to make room for other stuff). When this process happens very much, things get very very slow because processing has to read from the disk, rather than from memory. This is another reason services often try to give up once they exceed a certain limit set by the designers.

&gt; I don't think we ever tell other girls they 'hug like a boy' or 'sew like a boy' or 'cook like a boy' and mean it as an insult. newlinechar &gt; By the way, 'you throw like a girl' is an insult -- ask any third-grader. It's an insult, and it's abso-fucking-lutely meant to be one. So is 'you cry like a girl,' 'you run like a girl,' 'you dance like a girl,' and any of its corollaries.   newlinechar  newlinechar I never said it wasn't an insult - it definitely is. I just don't think it's necessarily saying that women are somehow lesser. It's not *being a woman* that they are saying is bad, it's *not being a man*. At least, that's my take on that saying - I may very well be completely wrong.   newlinechar  newlinechar As for the 'you hug like a boy' thing, I have definitely been told things like that. If I ever struggle with my emotions or children or cooking or some other traditionally feminine subject, I will inevitably get 'you're such a man.' It's a phrase I'd love to hear if I were picking up something heavy or breaking a tree in half with my manly pecs, but in that context it's definitely patronising.   newlinechar  newlinechar I guess what I'm really trying to say over all these comments is that gender roles suck, but there they are.

Tee hee. :-) newlinechar  newlinechar I'll put it like this. When I was about 22 years old, my little company was only starting to take off. At that point, I was living in the Central European country I come from, and I was proud of myself for making $1,000 - $2,000 a month. I felt successful and wealthy compared to my relatives, peers, and parents - all of whom I grew up thinking of as middle class people; not poor. newlinechar  newlinechar Then I visited a friend in the US who was living in poverty, with an alcoholic and disabled mother, surviving on government assistance and food stamps. newlinechar  newlinechar She had a laptop. I did not. And a digital camera. Which I did not. During that trip, I answered my business emails from an internet cafe in San Francisco. I traveled with a near-empty backpack, and a single change of clothes. (But that may be simply because I'm a slob.) newlinechar  newlinechar $30k doesn't sound like a lot to you. But that's because you're comparing yourself to a country chock-full of rich people who like to show off. Also yes; the money doesn't go as far as back in Europe, where the government fixes your teeth, and it's free. This could be considered an aspect of the US that could be improved. newlinechar  newlinechar But my point is, for better or worse, you do live in a land of opportunity. Use it.
Please do; I'd love to hear your opinion!
Ha harsh. Jesus.  newlinechar  newlinechar Am I happy about the situation? No. But I already have plenty invested into this club. I'm a recent transplant to NYC and wanted to find something to help me be a part of my new home. So far I've met a lot of great people through supporting this team. I have season tickets, so I'm financially invested. I also know one of the players, so I want to support him.  newlinechar  newlinechar I just want to watch some quality soccer. The politics of this ride have been annoying.

It's mostly likely not as severe as it immediately seems. The face has an immense amount of small blood vessels, and even small (and harmless) cuts produce a lot of blood initially, making it seem as if it is a dire wound. It looks and probably feels terrible, but probably no permanent or severe damage. 
You must not have read the article.  newlinechar No one did die. Pastor  drew down on, and wounded the man who brandished the gun.  newlinechar  newlinechar There were also 20 children around. Don't know if they were threatened by the man, but they were safe when the cops showed up.

That was a sincere thank you, it does make sense, I agree with everything you just said, especially the loch n load, not only does it look weird, but it also is OP, the only reason valve made it have 3 shots is because everyone would wine and wine about how scouts drain their ammo. As that's the only reason I see for it to have 3 shots. newlinechar  newlinechar Well since you seem very intune with weapon balance, how about minigun buffs? The Brass Beast is not effected by the damage nerf, because by the time the Minigun is ramped up and firing it could of killed 2 Brass Beast Heavies, and it's all about damage and takes so long to start up, why take even longer? And the Tomislav not be effected by the accuracy nerf, because its all about fast and effective spin up.

The physical books sound good. Tyrael is one of the characters that I always see and think 'that is one of the most badass looking characters I've ever seen'. So I might give that book a search.

I'm a better writer than I am a speaker, so before I go to talk to people about things, I write my words down and read what I've written out loud and to my dogs (they say they don't mind). That way I don't jumble my words when it's go time.  newlinechar  newlinechar However, I have the gift of drawing people in (I get it from my Dad, who is a gifted speaker), and I'm told I'm enigmatic. That helps when I'm trying to get what I want, as I'm able to explain it to people in a relatable way. Actually, yes, relatability is key. If you can figure out what your audience wants to hear and deliver it to them in a specific manner, you're going to get what you want. Maybe not the first time, but as long as you're not afraid of hearing the word 'no' (I LOVE the word no - party time!), then you'll end up with the prize. Be persistent.  newlinechar  newlinechar Good luck, sir/madam.

Ugh, it does suck SO much. Way more than I expected. My SO and I have done the long-distance thing for a few months a few times over the course of our relationship but not like this. The other times, it was temporary and we knew the end date. Plus, we were both in places where we had friends, places to live, etc. This time around, everything about it blows. newlinechar  newlinechar The explanation is rather complicated, but in a nutshell: I took a job transfer. I was planning to buy a house. I figured there was no point in moving all of our stuff twice (once to an apt and once to the new house). It turned out to be really hard to find a house. Then it also turned out to be hard to find an apartment. Meanwhile, we haven't been able to find anyone to take over our lease on our old house. There's a lot more to it than that, but basically a lot of things conspired to make the living-in-a-shitty-hotel period a lot longer than expected. Honestly, I'm pretty much at the 'fuck this job, I'd rather be with my family' point now. I thought it was going to be a great job, but there's a whole lot I wasn't told about up front that makes it not at all great.

I had a friend about two years ago who posted her wedding pictures online. She had thousands of Facebook friends, so when one of those friends liked the pictures, it apparently showed up on some stranger's feed. He sent her an obscene message basically asking how her and her new husband can have sex when she was so fat. This was a total freaking stranger who felt it was appropriate to write that to someone about her wedding pictures. I have never once posted a picture of myself online after that day because of that.  newlinechar  newlinechar But with this subreddit - there is one really creepy thing that they do also. They take pictures of overweight and obese people in public, going about their daily activities, without them knowing, for no other reason besides to post pictures online and make fun of them.  newlinechar  newlinechar I am obese due to medical reasons and use a cane. If I came back home after running errands and found out that I was on the front page of Reddit because some asshole took a picture of me when I was grocery shopping or whatever, it would cause emotional damage and I probably wouldn't want to leave the house again.

Completely honest. It's the most accurate insight into the real cause of the problem, Riot's handling of it, and Riot's responsibility.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm in Mexico right now and I used to get 50-80ms (we're peered directly to our largest ISP; do this for a living) to NA servers at the beginning of this year, right now I'm at 170-190ms. newlinechar  newlinechar That's almost a 150% increase, the player base certainly did not expand by that much over the year. I also suspect this maybe an architectural problem with their software and not a networking issue. It seems like they've hit some sort of bottleneck in their architecture design. This is a much more dangerous problem, and it would explain why they haven't been able to solve the issue over such a long period of time and why throwing money at the problem won't alleviate the issues.

Actually, a bit thinner, except in the back (T-34 had 51 mm back armor), cause the T-34 has up to 81 mm armor. newlinechar  newlinechar Type 61 seems just mediocre on paper. It would have been excellent during WW2, but since it was designed during the start of the Vietnam war and in service until the end of it, the Type 61 does not seem to be more than a mediocre tank. Meanwhile, the M48 Patton had about the same or even better stats than the Type 61. And the M48 seized in production in 1959. 2 whole years before the production of the Type 61 even started. Hell, I think even the M36 could have been a dangerous opponent to the Type 61. newlinechar  newlinechar End of rant.

The difference is in communication. While Riot did eventually release a stealth rework for League of Legends, it took longer than expected.

It's not a promise, or holding out information 'until it's ready', it's treating your community like people and engaging them in matters of design and the philosophy of your game. I wouldn't say Riot or any company is perfect, or really that you can define what perfect communication is, but this is an example of something that Anet simply refuses to do that would go a long way to provide insight. Even the CDI is mostly Devs nodding in agreement or asking questions as opposed to explaining their ideas or what's feasible with their systems.

Did I not call out Keynesian economics? That's the issue: inflationary currency. It devalues our money's purchasing power so most can't live without a social safety net. It's a terrible system of dependence. And my parents are on social security as well, by the way.

Hi. Honest answer to this is that there are a range of opinions. My family held back on buying sacks of oysters for a year or so after the oil spill, but mainly because the market had changed, not because there was a perceptible change in the quality of oysters, If the oysters weren't good, they weren't going to be sold in the first place, so the only metric to consider was price.I would say our oysters have doubled or tripled in price in 10 years.  newlinechar  newlinechar But, honestly, there was never a real interruption in availability or quality, hurricanes or oil spills be damned. And this winter's supply has been above par.

&gt; I'm likely -1 on this proposal. I've held a different position in the past, but by now I'm thoroughly convinced that if we introduce scalar typehints, they should be strict. newlinechar  newlinechar Why can't we have non-strict type hints? I realise that strict type hints are desirable for certain reasons, but they fit very poorly with the rest of the language (see [my comment below](http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/2qy7b5/rfc_scalar_type_hints/cnawwnv)) and are unlikely to ever make it into PHP. So why, then, oppose the addition of non-strict hints? Surely these hints, which offer many (albeit not all) of the benefits of strict hints, are far better than nothing? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Apart from being consistent with the existing behavior of typehints newlinechar  newlinechar This RFC is consistent with the existing behaviour of extension functions (which match all userland type hints in behaviour). Besides, strict hints would be inconsistent with the rest of the language. PHP has never been strict for scalar types, and I think they'd make a rather awkward fit. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;, it is also possible to reason about strict typehints statically. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;This means that an IDE or other tool will be able to perform meaningful analysis based on typehinted functions. E.g. if you pass the result of a `string` function to an `int` parameter, your code is definitely wrong and you can be told so. Loose (casting) typehints do not offer this possibility, because a string can be or can not be a valid input to an int parameter depending on the exact value. newlinechar  newlinechar You have a point there. Unfortunately, casting hints prevent certain types of validation. However, some type combos always work and some always don't, so you can still error for certain cases (NULL, array, resource, or object where scalar expected). newlinechar  newlinechar *[Side note: Static analysis for these kinds of type hints is far more interesting. Can you figure out, statically, whether some string is always non-empty, or if a float will always be a valid int? :)]* newlinechar  newlinechar While they do prevent certain types of validation, they don't prevent optimisations, so HHVM (and perhaps Zend in future) can still benefit from the type information. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; For the same reason loose typehints are also more fragile. Code that worked in casual testing during development will fail in production when unexpected, improperly validated user input is encountered. newlinechar  newlinechar This is also true to an extent, but it is alleviated partly if code is fully type hinted. If your entire codebase has type hints, such errors can be caught early before they're passed to other functions. Once values are converted to integers, they stay integers (unless you pass it to something taking a string).

Just basic science, i guess. newlinechar  newlinechar To maintain a large weight you have to continue putting in an excess amount of calories.  As your body continues to store all that garbage and you put on weight, you end up exerting a lot more energy doing daily tasks than a person of average weight will.

Sorry for not clarifying. [Here's a picture](http://i51.tinypic.com/1z35gup.jpg). Full Metal Jacket bullets are still composed of lead.

The FMJ acts as a lubricant and prevents exposed lead from being left on every surface it touches. In that regard, any box of ammunition that says FMJ on it won't have cartridges with exposed lead bullets unless there was an error during production.

After reading your post and then your comment right here, I've come to the conclusion that this would not be helping most people and it would only help the 1 percent. I am in a 24/7 war clan where if we aren't in war or in the queue for a war, something is probably very wrong. War is insanely profitable for all of us on all levels, including for those at the top who supply CC troops for everyone down low, when we win. Losing is a different story, but also a story for a different day. newlinechar  newlinechar In this ELO you are proposing, you are basically making it harder for new clans to come up from the bottom and also essentially splitting the clan war search even more. Right now wars are matched based on overall clan strength.

Now if you add in ranks, that's even more time for the clan that just wants a war to wait. Efficiency is what SC is trying to give right now, your solution just doesn't give it.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But I do applaud you for taking the time to write the post.
Just out of curiosity, how would buying the optical converter be any better?

He probably was on the fringes among the general populace with his secret marriages, Council of Fifty, his commands of repeated drill and ceremony performances by the Nauvoo Legion and his created theology. newlinechar  newlinechar Lol very true. But I'm still not sure. 'Charm,' 'charisma,' and 'personality' are so much of the picture we have of him. That he had followers at all (much less thousands of them) suggests 'psychopath.'

Think about it though. You have 15 or 16 slots, and assuming you have an epic in each slot that's 15 or 16 temporal crystals. newlinechar  newlinechar You also have 4 enchants that cost 4 crystals each, so right there that's your 16 crystals from DEing every piece of gear you replaced (assuming a whole new set). On top of that you have weapon enchants, which adds 3 crystals for tanks/heals, then 15 for most DPS classes (30 for dual wielders). This *is* ingoring your daily CD/workorders, but enchants this expack are so expensive that I don't think the price will crash much once BRF gets released.

Exactly. The producers have paid some lip service to comic book destiny, but the (post-Crisis) origin story for the Dinah Laurel Lance of the comics is that she was simply inspired by her not-dead mother and her friends to help people. It makes no sense that they decided to up-end Laurel's entire character arc to have her become Black Canary because of anger fueled by a loss when they could have just had her become disillusioned of the effectiveness of the justice system and decide to be a vigilante. I was rewatching S1 recently and found that the set-up was already there: Laurel mentions in 1x02 that there's corruption in the DA's office. Sara could have been kept alive, and appear on a recurring basis, hesitant at first to see Laurel move even further into a life of danger and violence but eventually agreeing to help train her, along with Ted. newlinechar  newlinechar Instead, we have Laurel just kind of flailing about in her rage, Sara dead and basically reduced to a plot point (and Thea as another casualty, having all her agency taken from her). I don't get why they made this decision.

No problem. I used to do a lot of trading in TF2, and sold an item of this caliber myself! newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Digital economies are built up in games like these, using real money or digital items (usually keys to open crates like these). It's not hard to imagine buying a key to unlock a skin for $2.50. Since you can trade items, the keys now have a market value when they're not directly sold. Now imagine the chances of opening this specific item to be 1 in 200. That means this item is rare, and should theoretically be worth around 200 keys, like a winning lottery ticket. That's not too hard to imagine either. It just so happens that the market value of the item (the price people are willing to pay for it) correlates to the rarity of the item. This is partially because there are so few of them, but also because it looks really nice. So if you buy it at $400, the price is very likely to stay at $400 or even go up. So traders sometimes buy these items and sell them for a profit which is one reason someone would buy this. But even if they didn't, they can sell the item for relatively the same value, or take a loss on it once they get tired of the item, so it's not really that insane. newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR: supply+demand creates market value. The key to making all this happen is to make a popular game with built-in pseudo currency and have high discrepancies in rarity between the most rare and least rare items.
I wanted to reply to that comment last week, but life got in the way. As you can see here, sometimes it's necessary to reiterate a point when it's critical to understanding the plot. But I share your frustration, I prefer to work out the ramifications of a logical argument myself than have them force fed to me.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's a pity there wasn't a 'do you need another explanation' prompt or two, a potential advantage VNs have that books or films lack, but then I guess that could disrupt the flow of the story or result in some users overestimating their understanding, ultimately leaving them as lost as OP. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, just in case you were unaware, each Umineko episode was originally released around 6 months apart, so just as with book sequels, the first few hours includes some subtle recap information that can be a tad tiresome if you're marathoning the VN.

I think that a lot of /r/dota 2 is actually as brain-damaged as you actually. The top comments in the 'PPD witchhunt thread' and other threads really display a pretty poor sense of how the dota 2 scene actually works. newlinechar  newlinechar Nobody is baiting with hints at roster changes because they want 'click money' (holy shit do you actually think anyone makes money in esports from pay-per-click adds?). People bait at hints of roster changes for various reasons but mostly because it draws eyes their way and they can get away with it if they are vague enough that reddit and twitter will love it (lowest common denominators in esports) yet non-specific enough that it doesn't fuck them over with the upper level organizations and teams. newlinechar  newlinechar Roster changes end up not occurring because of a huge combination of things: Teams work out their issues that they were vaguely venting on twitter/twitch chats/skypes, shitstorms on places like le reddit over players happen (It's pretty clear which players viewers like),  and half the reason no one just comes out and says who is going where is because it isn't set in stone yet. newlinechar  newlinechar Hope that helps you a bit /u/puihpuih!

Thanks for that warning.
&gt; so I wouldn't be surprised if he was just trying to use them newlinechar  newlinechar That's how I read it. We don't know if Unalaq already held the throne in the North when he joined the Red Lotus; if we assume that he did not, then I could see him playing himself off as a rebel heir/traitor to the throne, because yeah, I doubt that the RL would let a Water Tribe Chieftan join them, since they're so staunchly against world leaders. newlinechar  newlinechar As for why Unalaq would want to join, Zaheer told Korra that the RL originally intended to release Vaatu from his prison in order to spread chaos. While they didn't plan on anybody becoming a Dark Avatar, Unalaq may have become aware of their plan to release Vaatu, and he could have seen that as being conducive to his goal of uniting the humans and the spirits. Ironically, the RL ended up teaching him about Raava and Vaatu and the origins of the Avatar, which I assume is what inspired his plan to become a Dark Avatar. At the very least, the RL were quite knowledgeable in spiritual matters, and that would have been of some use to Unalaq. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, something that interests me is that Unalaq *did* say something very Red Lotus-ey in 'Harmonic Convergence': newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Unalaq: 'After today there will be no more Water Tribe; no more nations of any kind.' newlinechar  newlinechar Now compare that with what Zaheer said in 'The Stakeout': newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Zaheer: 'The idea of having nations and governments is as foolish as keeping the human and spirit realms separate.' newlinechar  newlinechar So it seems that the two were clearly in agreement that the world's governments needed to be dismantled and that the human and spirit realms needed to be united. The only difference is that Zaheer was sought what he believed to be *true* freedom with no rulers of any kind, whereas Unalaq would have remained in a position of power even after he dissolved the other government systems in order to secure his world order (because, I mean, if the RL were opposed to the Avatar, then logically, they would be equally as opposed to a Dark Avatar as well). Zaheer wanted chaos, but Unalaq (seemingly) still intended for there to be some kind of order, administrated by himself as a Dark Avatar. newlinechar  newlinechar What I *don't* understand is how Unalaq and Vaatu could have ever coexisted. Unalaq believed that what Wan brought *was* chaos, and he wanted to change that by undoing everything that Wan did. However, he really did wish for a harmonious coexistence between humans and spirits, but with Vaatu free and unopposed by Raava, life would have been anything but. They say several times that if Vaatu won the battle against Raava, then a 10,000-year reign of darkness would ensue. Which doesn't sound very 'harmonious' to me.

Actually one of the big reasons BE didn't appeal to me was the flatness of the sponsors! It's interesting to think about, because you'd think with the ability to choose between different colonists and ship parts and cargos, the variety would be really high and diverse. But I think a lot of people end up just picking the same choices over and over again and it ends up being a lot flatter. newlinechar  newlinechar If you compare to civ 5, each civ has a trait, and two unique elements (buildings, units, etc.). They actually end up being much more unique than my factions and there's so many more of them (18 in the original)! newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, when designing their traits, I didn't try to go too overboard. Some of the original sponsors have pretty interesting traits (free virtue every 5 virtues, orbital units stay in orbit longer) and I tried to keep my traits comparable. I think the major difference and where a number of people express grievances are how there's like a bonus and a weakness for each faction. It's breaks away from the original design, but weaknesses are such a critical part of the original SMAC factions that you can't ignore them in any reinterpretation. It isn't the best fit in BE, but I honestly wish weaknesses would be an area more often explored in Civ (though I understand why it's not). newlinechar  newlinechar Thank you very much for the input though! Do you have anything you'd like to talk about in terms of the balance between individual factions?

Well, to be honest, I feel like by opting out of child support, but by getting to see the child, he's getting all of the benefits (watching kid grow up, offer friendly advice, hang out), along with none of the responsibility (cost, sacrifice of time [when he doesn't want to]/energy, being the bad guy about keeping the kid out of trouble, etc).  newlinechar  newlinechar It's hard for me to explain, and understand, myself... Because I feel like if I did adopt a child, I wouldn't mind the bio-parents stopping by every once in awhile.  newlinechar  newlinechar I guess it's kinda like the difference of how you know someone.

There are several different types of surgery. From the reversible lap band, where they essentially section off part of the stomach with a plastic tie, to completely rewiring the guts and reconnecting things in different ways. I had 3/4 of my stomach removed so I pretty much have a tube instead of a stomach. Unless a person has had a band, it's pretty hard to regain the weight because you simply can't eat any amount approximating what a 'normal' person would be able to chow down. You know pretty quick when you've had enough. Exceeding that brings discomfort and pain, and can cause puking. As such eating small but well balanced meals are a must.

After blowing the tires like that, the pilots should not have continued taxiing to the gate. This is for many reasons, including not causing further damage to the aircraft, runway, or taxiway surfaces (which all happened here, see [the pic here](http://avherald.com/h?article=47f968b7&amp;opt=0)). According to the AV Herald article, the pilots didn't realize that anything had happened. newlinechar  newlinechar What /u/4fifty8 is saying is that after landing and blowing all 4 tires, the pilots should have definitely noticed that something was wrong and they should not have been taxiing.
None. Where your flair?
That's actually not too bad! For some reason in my head, it seemed like something that could never happen. Definitely on my MUA bucket list.

It's not just the APA who considers it a medical disorder, and if it wasn't for needing to keep it around for insurance and treatment reasons it wouldn't be in DSM-V. newlinechar  newlinechar But just in case you need some other groups: newlinechar  newlinechar * American Association of Pediatrics newlinechar * American Counseling Association newlinechar * World Health Organization newlinechar *  World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) newlinechar  newlinechar So you know, there are other groups who support the proper treatment of and care for trans people.  newlinechar  newlinechar And beyond that, even if it gets classed as a mental disorder again, what does that change? The only proven treatment will still be transitioning, and the medical research being done will still be pointing at gendered brain structures as being responsible for causing the issue.  newlinechar  newlinechar So the only issue I see is from society being prejudiced towards mental illnesses as usually.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also if you're going to use a slur to describe a minority group you lose a lot of weight behind your argument.

Torches and Supermodel is so vastly different.  newlinechar  newlinechar I recommend checking out Torches first, although you will most likely not like Supermodel as much as Torches.

You can determine the level range of the creature using draw low level adamatoises only let you draw blizzard. Use quisit's degenerator if squall can't renzokuken them in one turn.

But I hear all the time that the confidence itself is attractive. While obviously if one is blessed with some better genes and just doesn't recognize it then the matched confidence will only help, it still stands to reason that confidence can help the less fortunate. And maybe just being confident about your personality, sense of humor, wit, etc. puts different feelers out there. Just sayin'.

If it's a gas model, I would bet a Bertazonni's broiler is similar if not hotter than your Weber. Modern high end home ranges often have pretty darn powerful IR broilers. Charcoal *can* get way up in the high hundreds, but it's very hard to do that in practice - you would need to force air into the bottom of the grill via a fan, and/or to cook directly on a chimney starter. The Weber on its own is unlikely to get past 500F. newlinechar  newlinechar The newer Wolfs with the infrared charbroiler actually come with a plate you can insert between the grill surface and the broiler to further dissipiate the heat from the lowest setting, they're that hot. I've heard of folks using IR thermometers to measure their pizza stones at 750F or higher after 10m under the broiler. newlinechar  newlinechar Also if your range has a convection mode, 500F with the fan on is an awesome way to finish a roast. You won't get as deep a sear as you would with a radiant heat like a broiler or your charcoal, but for odd shaped things like a roast it will do a better job of cooking the nooks and crannies. newlinechar  newlinechar All in all, it sounds like you have several very good options to choose from.

It's about five blocks from mine. This doesn't 'solve homelessness' in any way. This only enables the chronically homeless population by warehousing them. It attracts other chronically homeless people, and most of the housing is more like a dog-house than a real home.

&gt; Well, to be honest, I feel like by opting out of child support, but by getting to see the child, he's getting all of the benefits (watching kid grow up, offer friendly advice, hang out), along with none of the responsibility (cost, sacrifice of time [when he doesn't want to]/energy, being the bad guy about keeping the kid out of trouble, etc).  newlinechar  newlinechar But he has no parental rights.

Hm I was able to turn up quite a few results, try searching something along the lines of 'india builds up chinese border'.  Here are a couple of the first results: newlinechar  newlinechar  - [India scales up military forces on disputed China border](http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2014/0521/India-scales-up-military-forces-on-disputed-China-border) newlinechar  newlinechar  - [India-China Border Engagement](http://thediplomat.com/2014/08/india-china-border-engagement/) newlinechar  newlinechar What's important to realize is that this isn't just an isolated incident, even these two articles detail events three months apart.  There's been a lot of contention and pressure on both sides ever since the [Sino-Indian War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War) of the 60s.  Things seem to be heating up lately and needless to say that if the two countries with the highest populations wage war with one another, it will have ripple effects that will affect everyone.  Not to mention the fact that both nations have gigantic amounts of international trade with western nations, mostly in manufacturing and human resources.

the error will always be 'The Prepaid Card code you entered is incorrect or is no longer valid', even if its a invalid code or if it was already activated before, but the fact that the card code wasnt scratched before clearly indicate that the card was simply not activated by the cashier at the time of your purchase since theres no way to discover the code on the card unless it is scratched, and that code need to be activated at the transaction by the cashier to be redeemable, which clearly wasnt done.

Women in the same fiends as men generally get paid about the same.  This changes in executive level positions where you can negotiate your wages where generally women for many reasons don't negotiate as aggressively as men.  Secondly if you measure how much women vs men get paid by annual income there is a small but statistically relevant discrepancy on average which can be accounted for by maternity leave.

If it's a smaller program, this naturally happens. The people in my program  are somewhat close because we are in every class together and even work together for our research assistantships. Part-time people kinda group to themselves, because they're in the same boat. Honestly, they just don't know you and maybe you should try to break down the barriers if you want to get to know them.  newlinechar  newlinechar Start slow by asking about a paper or topic that was discussed in class. If it's someone you've had classes with before, strike up conversation about some aspect of it you've liked/disliked/found interesting. I've also always found that simply saying hello to someone when you see them can make them warm up to you. After getting to know some people a bit better ask about creating a study group, possibly over some drinks (if you drink) or food. I know it sucks to put in the effort to make friends if you're shy. But it really helps!

OP is Korean (IIRC) and asking about westerners.

My point is less about the training and more about the position that you are in when trouble happens.  You could be home, with your baby sleeping in another room when a crack head bounces through your door and wants to fight.  Running away isn't always an option, and this is generally understood when someone volunteers for a position where they provide security.

But let's not pretend everything is comparable either. We don't invade neighbors to snatch up the land.  We could probably do in Puerto Rico what Putin did in Crimea but we don't.  In fact, we'd have a better claim on forcibly making Puerto Rico a state than Russia has in Crimea.  The analogy isn't perfect but it's functional.   newlinechar  newlinechar On another note, I think one important difference is that the US uses soft power better and more effectively so Russia has to dip into its hard power from time to time.  I think we can make a reasonable argument that luring a country through the promise of a better future is objectively better than sending troops into a country to break yourself off a piece.

I'm not sure if you mean it like this...but it comes across like there's some sinister conspiracy where employers are putting women down.  I don't see it like that.   newlinechar  newlinechar The employer's job is to hire the best person for the job under the best circumstances.   newlinechar  newlinechar If a person is talented and can produce results, then they can command the salary that they want.   newlinechar  newlinechar Swapping jobs will always be challenging in any market, but if people want to move forward; then they have to decide on what they are willing to accept from here on in and go for it.   newlinechar  newlinechar For example, Asians weren't though of much during the late 70s but now they command some level of respect depending on the field that they are in.   newlinechar  newlinechar In the end, what are you proposing is the alternative?  If an employer doesn't want to pay fairly (or something that doesn't seem to be fair), what should a person do?  I'm saying that they should suck it up and move on.  What's the alternative?  We already know that an employer will pay the minimum that they can in order to keep an employee so what should they do?  What do you propose a person do if they feel like they aren't paid fair?

I have a lot of problems with it, here are a few: newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Stage selection is horrid. So many stages with hazards and bosses (probably the worst addition to the game). Lots of walk off stages but I'm not huge on those since edge guarding and recovery is such a huge part of the game. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. Limited online options. For glory completely neglects stages with platforms, team for glory can't be played with stocks, and Miis and custom moves can't be used online. newlinechar  newlinechar 3. Menus are completely baffling. Why hide options in 'single player and more'?  newlinechar  newlinechar 4. The game doesn't save your screen name by player, so you constantly have to pick your name every time you play. newlinechar  newlinechar 5. Single player modes are severely limited. Smash Run is a far cry from SSE and Adventure Mode in Melee. Target practice is the same for all characters and is more akin to Angry Birds than anything. newlinechar  newlinechar 6. Gameplay in general favors defensive players who shield and block all the time. It'd be nice to have mechanics that balance defensive and offensive play styles.

I agree with you to an extent, however I'm not crazy about the new mac laptops.  The built in battery bugs me for starters.  Not everyone can afford to purchase a completely new laptop once the battery starts to go.  Does apple offer some sort of replacement policy?  The probook that I purchased used cost me $300 and with a ram upgrade and a ssd I've only spent $500 total on it so far.  It runs much cooler than a mac too so there is little or no danger of wearing out the motherboard due to heat.  I've had a few mac pros in the past and the mobos always fail eventually due to this oversight on the part of apple.  They're just way to excited on making their laptops thin and sleek IMO.  I'm currently running my PC laptop with pro tools 11 and I can use lots of plugins without issue.  If I had $3000 (canadian) to blow on a single computer I would probably go the mac route too, but instead I have opted to build a desktop PC for video editing.  So much more room for upgrading don't you think?  I also hate how apple forces people to upgrade with every new version of the OS.  I get that they optimize the OS for the latest generation, but they often assume that people can afford to just sell the old gear and replace it with the new stuff.  Anyway that's why I recommended looking for a pc  laptop with an expansion slot it fixes the firewire issue while keeping the cost down to about half of a mac book pro.

It's good to know that someone has read this and can understand my situation. Thank you and have a happy new year.
Busted for their time.  Ancestral Recall doesn't count because it was created for a completely different game.

I'm not sure how much you follow MLS, frankly. The league has somehow managed to field 19 other teams without relying on foreign sugar daddies. The one similar experiment, Chivas USA, is universally understood to have been a failure. NY2 as a concept existed well before CFG's involvement and could have (should have) been done without them.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't have a club. I'm not interested in supporting a team from some other city or country, some place to which I have no connection. I grew up in Seattle but the MLS Sounders were not born until 15 years after I moved away, and anyway I don't want to support a team whose matches I'll never be able to attend (my relationship to the NFL is different, because the Seahawks were an important part of my childhood and I'm not going to leave that particular tribe). I love New York, I belong in New York, and I want a soccer club that puts New York first. Of course I know it's not going to be as rich or powerful as MCFC. That's not the point. newlinechar  newlinechar Finally, the fact that Lampard never had an MLS contract is part of the problem. We were lied to. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm still willing to give NYCFC a chance, because they are still the only top-level soccer club based in New York City, but I hate the so-called 'partnership' with MCFC (and our MCFC imitation kits and all that bullshit) and I would really prefer that somebody who gives a fuck about NYC buy them out.

Ok, I just tried this a couple times. It seems unreliable for Zurg's dungeon.

It's completely unreliable.  You'd need at least 1 of your unit to crit and even if you hit the crit cap, that's still a lot of luck involved. If you were unlucky and didn't land a crit on your first turn, you're pretty much toast even with the boosted HC drop rate from Zelnite. I tried it with double maxwell + a light unit (Heidt) and had much better success.

If you're a girl who overhears that on the playground, it definitely begins to feel as though women are somehow lesser. After all, the insult isn't 'You don't throw like a boy,' but specifically 'you throw like a girl.' When it's leveled at you, it definitely feels like a denigration of your whole gender.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;  If I ever struggle with my emotions or children or cooking or some other traditionally feminine subject, I will inevitably get 'you're such a man.' It's a phrase I'd love to hear if I were picking up something heavy or breaking a tree in half with my manly pecs, but in that context it's definitely patronising.  newlinechar  newlinechar For what it's worth, I think that's shitty too, and I don't say it -- in the pejorative sense, that is. (I say it a lot when my husband opens a jar I can't get or fearlessly climbs on the roof to clean the gutters.) Maybe I should be a little more outspoken in calling it out as shitty when I hear it because it definitely is. Fuck people for trying to make you feel lousy about being a guy; that's not right either.  newlinechar  newlinechar Rigid gender roles *do* suck, and I think many of us can do better at recognizing it.

You are right but man, I guess the way they argue tires me out like no tomorrow. I was getting shit for smoking and how second hand smoke kills.

Clindamycin - it basically killed off most of the good flora &amp; fauna in my guts and it's taken a while to get back to quasi-normal.

I used the transcripts from police interviews and the 'View From LL2' blog extensively, and the theory espoused on that blog––that Jay committed the murder alone but enlisted the help of Jenn after the fact––makes the most sense to me in terms of accounting for where and when calls were made. This theory doesn't suppose premeditation, so the big blank spot/question mark is how/when/where Hae and Jay could have crossed paths that afternoon and what might have transpired that would have ended in her murder (presumably something to do with Stephanie).

Nope. Couldn't tell you the difference between a big steaming pile of poop and a freshly cut rose if I tried. I've never been able to smell anything... no idea what anything, absolutely anything smells like. And as far as I can tell I was born without it (no serious head injuries or any other trauma that could cause the loss of smell, at least as far as i'm aware of).

It would be way easier [and most likely more fun] to just pick a low magic RPG. D&amp;D, while lovely, isn't the end-all be-all and you will save everyone a lot of frustration just going another route. newlinechar  newlinechar If your really set on 5e and still want magic to be rare then I suggest that you do make it rare but don't limit the players because of it. Maybe healing potions aren't easy to buy, and maybe the Wizard will have to put a ton of work into finding a spellbook to get bonus spells from, but other than that just let the players be what they want to be.  newlinechar  newlinechar Adventurers already represent oddities within society, are the ones that cast strange and dangerous magicks really that *less* weird than the knight who can survive the breath of a *dragon* or fell a giant in a single blow. 
Well, you kind of have to be fat to achieve type 2. newlinechar  newlinechar As for type 1, we're usually taught proper diet and self care as soon as we're diagnosed (usually as young'ins), so that plays a large role. Also, we know the shit that will happen if we aren't careful with our health, so we tend to keep a pretty close eye on it.
I'd just say find anything you enjoy doing, it doesn't have to be video games but something that brings you peace. Like I said, a lot of people say 'you SHOULD meditate' if you feel anxious or 'you SHOULD go for a walk' but those make me feel worse. I'd much rather fuck shit up or watch an action movie. That'll calm me down first and maybe then I'll meditate or go for a walk. newlinechar  newlinechar But yeah the 'shoulds' are very bad thing to keep in your mind. I understand you feel bad about a lot of the things you 'should' have accomplished, and maybe you 'should' have done them, but use that as a positive to make you better in the future. newlinechar  newlinechar Why didn't you do the things you 'should' have done? Should you have even done them? Are they even realistic expectations you could have fulfilled? If they are, what caused you to not them? Maybe too much pressure on yourself? Unrealistic expectations? newlinechar  newlinechar We're all different and anxiety is a complex motherfucker so none of us can expect to find that cure-all answer that fixes everything. What works for me at least is to ground myself first of all. I've learned that for me I can't trust anything when I'm in that anxiety/depression mindset. Seriously, the next time you're in a contemplative mindset think of you how your state of mind was after an amazing workout/or your  more calm, happier mindset and contrast that to your anxious and/or depressive mindset and try to calibrate towards your more natural state.  newlinechar  newlinechar So find a way, anything really, that will ground you and once you feel more 'normal' then start figuring out what you need to figure out. So if you're stressed about school, or about finding a job, don't go in with that impulsive anxious mindset. Tell that to fuck off, focus on something that will ground you, and when you're in that more stable mindset go to the next step and start tackling those in a more logical and sensible way. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I tend to catch myself in those cycles when I have nothing going on. If I'm aimlessly browsing reddit or whatever that's when they start to come and grow. It's hard to do but try to catch them as they come on, and start to become aware of your feelings start to change and how your anxiety rises, and what to do to prevent that. For me, I just stay occupied. On anything. I find a new TV series to watch. I play new video games. Sometimes I'll shake up my entire routine, just so I stay out of that auto pilot. Auto pilot = thoughts, thoughts =feelings, feelings = anxiety, anxiety = loops. No bueno.

How do you figure?

It would actually be roughly equivalent to both, your version just doesn't happen to be relevant to the question at hand.  More specifically, the example would apply to any case where the deceased parent had not established some form of support in the event of their death.  (i.e. a large enough life insurance policy, survivor's benefits/pension etc.) newlinechar  newlinechar Either way, you're sidestepping the main point: if children have a 'right' to the support of two parents, it's reasonable to punish *any* parent who makes an affirmative decision to create or keep a child in a situation where the child will be deprived of that right.  This is ridiculous, of course, but if it isn't true we basically have to accept that it is morally and legally acceptable for a parent to unilaterally place a child in a position where they will be deprived of one parent's support.  If that's true, it's actually *easier* to justify the male equivalent from a moral perspective, since a man preemptively disclaiming parenthood is much more likely to lead to an abortion (and no child to be deprived of anything) than a woman voluntarily becoming a single parent (which effectively guarantees it). newlinechar  newlinechar It's an unusual approach to the argument, but it's not necessarily an invalid one.

The Kings started off the season playing decent, scrappy above-.500 ball (they were like 9-6 or something) in the really tough West. Then DeMarcus Cousins, probably their best player and definitely their lynchpin, got pneumonia(?) and was out for a lot of games, and their record predictably got worse.  So then the coach was fired 'for not meeting win-loss expectations'.  Oh, also their star player is notoriously moody and doesn't get along with coaches, until this one.  Ty Corbin, an assistant, was made the interim coach: consensus here is that he isn't very good and was only a placeholder until the planned replacement coach came aboard.  But now he has been made coach for the rest of the season.  Oh, also the Kings have sucked since this happened and are dropping away from any chance at a playoff spot. newlinechar  newlinechar So: newlinechar  newlinechar  - Why fire a coach for losing when his best player is out sick, when he was winning before that. newlinechar  newlinechar  - If you are going to fire him, why wouldn't you have a plan ready beyond 'promote his marginally competent assistant'? newlinechar  newlinechar  - In general, the team seemed like it was moving forward, making strides towards improvement and had a chance to claw their way into a playoff seed, especially with OKC losing so much while their stars were out.  But now it seems like ownership threw that in the dumpster for no particular apparent reason.
doesn't mean they didn't either.

nah it's actually from when I was in elementary school because I really fucking liked hamsters especially hamtaro so some uppity lil kid started calling me squeak so it's been a nickname I've had ever since then
When all my troubles seemed so far away
&gt; This is happening to me as well, glad I'm not alone. You on windows phone?? Whenever i tap the icon i just get sent back to the home screen. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, on a windows phone too.  Guess it's outage related.  Uninstalled and reinstalled smartglass which did nothing.  Hopefully will be resolved soon.  Thanks.
I'm just excited to be doing something to help people. I can use my art to help me, and that's about it.
It's like the hydra. One dies, two take its place
Except Cosmo
It took 5 minutes to write the whole thing, including research. No trouble at all. newlinechar  newlinechar However, your excuse of being a 'troll' is difficult to believe, since your entire post history echoes your anti-poor/homeless sentiments. newlinechar  newlinechar I have a feeling this is just your way of saving face. That's okay though. If you don't believe the things you say then it's better for everyone. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Also, the claim that people are homeless because of poor decisions is actually very common, although untrue. So I'm not sure what you mean by 'obvious'. An obvious troll would be like homeless people are freeloading aliens or some ridiculous claim.
It certainly sounds interesting.
Just so you don't waste whiskey, I tried that potion. They do not mix. newlinechar  newlinechar It almost makes me hesitant to try banana chowder.
You'd think Sony would have their shit together.
You've convinced me. I shall aspire to this, and take it up as my own, *sempai.*
I dunno about wise. I only met him a couple times but I think he fell further into the 'evil genius' column. He was insanely smart... In a sociopath kind of way.
See, those aren't values that some Christians believe in.  'With us or against us' isn't uncommon to hear in protestant churches in the Deep South where I live.  I can't imagine Catholic services don't at least touch on it.
I don't think that means anything. A human by any other name is still a human, but there are certainly still differences among humans, in the same way there are differences among roses. That quote only serves to generalize a group, in this context. You could say that about any group, and it doesn't prove anything. newlinechar  newlinechar 'A faggot by any other name is still a faggot'. See?
Neither. It'd be an insult to the founding ideas of this beautiful country to have presidential dynasties. Obama definitely was a refreshment (whether or not his policies were good is another matter), but a return to the same old names would only increase people's cynicism toward the system.
I agree with you wholeheartedly. I was merely defending the part of /u/Donutfreak's argument that giving them coats and a bed for the night or calling the police to get them help is not a practical solution to the problem. 
That. And that's good enough for me. Must be good enough for lots of other folks, too. Somehow I don't think Snakes was going to give them any business, anyway.
You're a white teenage boy. How am I not surprised.

There may be exceptions, but those would be exceptions.  This is the rule.
Nah it's cool. The best posts are ones like this where there are multiple completely unrelated arguments/dramathngies.
How about this little guy? http://magiccards.info/ia/en/203.html
Their argument is 'It could be Srhbutts!' when it might as well be 'It could be Obama!'
[](/derpysad) Must be nice... ='(
&gt;Honestly, Korra's fit and muscular, but she's not a body builder. All these extremely ripped versions just don't strike me as being 'her'. newlinechar  newlinechar I agree 100% 
That's because it was SEC vs SEC and Team Chaos. Now that we are playing a non-SEC team they are against us.
It's endometriosis. It sucks ass. 
He rejected you because you're paupers and couldn't even dream of paying his wages. I dunno what world you're living in but liverpool can't and never have been able to afford Falcao
The Wii was an overlocked gamecube. They could have made it an adapter for the GC if they wanted.
Sometimes you do fight fire with fire. That's why the phrase exists. 
Ah! I get it now. Haha. Guess I'm not smart enough to see it. 
Same here. Did he call 911 to report his screw up? If so, didn't he abuse the system?

What is the best way to network with top tier players within the game? Or find a coach? Is cash the only way? lol
I agree, and use this argument often in my Pro-Choice debate, but my mom waited till 28 to have me, My sister was at 27 and was planned. Guess what? She and my dad both abused us, and continue to do so to my siblings. Yes, those parents are *Less* likely. However,  that is only one facet of the problem. Sex ed won't cure NPD, for instance. 
New one is TLA still there are two more story arcs after the rift. 
Oh god I'm right there with you. I empathize with characters way to much. Most sad media wrecks me. Hell watching the end of a happy series seems like saying goodbye to friends to me and I get sad. But because of that I can enjoy it even more.  Just I couldn't wait for the anime of UBW and I experienced the studio Deen adaption back in the day. Its the reason I didn't get into fate stay night back then because it was so shit. So good luck my friend but don't play Heavens feel without UBW and if your waiting. Tsukihime is nice. 
Well-well my friend, I happen to have VLC and RES, thank you very much.
I know Angus plays in AC/DC.
I'm in it for the long run haha! Third year in a row I've watched the live stream, such a great way to bring in the new year
In NYC, where Renzo lives.
Was it a white M3? If so I have video which i'm editing as we speak. 
My kids wouldn't be raised properly. Diapers wouldn't be changed, balanced meals wouldn't be prepared, the house would look like a tornado ran thru it, laundry would not be done. Basically, if I have to go back to work, he's going to be moving out. If I'm going to do it all on my own I will be living solo while I do it. 
or some queens were prefered by the producers and therefore got a get out of jail free card one to many times.
