The entire ESPNFC television show is essentially a bunch of arrogant Scots who look down on Americans, US Soccer, and MLS, with no hint of irony despite the fact that they're from f*cking Scotland, because that's what the self-loathing Eurodouchebag college kids who started following the Premier League 2-3 years ago (see [demographics of /r/soccer](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/2qpzf4/the_rsoccer_2014300k_subscribers_census_results/cn8ehzw)) expect from soccer pundits. They'd do the exact same to your team if the opportunity arose.

Listen, I am not an NYCFC fan and will not pretend their existence doesn't piss me off because of the Chivas bullshit that foreshadowed this happening, but I do not blame NYCFC fans for it. That said, Third Rail needs to go fucking mental. NYCFC is Garber's baby, and if it fails, it is a direct Garber screw up, and if the Third Rail turns into an issue, the league will take notice. newlinechar  newlinechar You all need to protest, scream, yell, and do everything possible to cause a commotion. Every support group does, but the Third Rail needs to be the leader on this. There is going to be a lockout, and it is going to be ugly, but once it is over, the fans in this league need to send a goddamn message that **this bullshit cannot, will not, and will never be acceptable**. newlinechar  newlinechar This needs to be Garber's Watergate, Lewinsky, and Teapot Dome all in one. He needs to be gone. He is hurting the league, and we need to send the message to our owners that Garber cannot continue as commissioner.  This needs to be a coordinated effort, and I believe the Third Rail needs to be the leader of it.

Nope. Hi.
&gt;But, looking past the naming convention, we already have the bulldog repeater and the name bulldog doesn't represent a long range fighter very well, which is the primary attribute of the deep space fighter. newlinechar  newlinechar So, in other words, ignoring your primary argument, which you have been continuing to argue in this thread despite the lack of evidence supporting it (IMO). newlinechar  newlinechar Whether or not the name fits the purpose is a matter of opinion. I can't fault you your opinion, and I see where you're coming from, but IMO an equally primary attribute of the Bulldog according to its description is its stoutness and durability, which the name reflects quite well. newlinechar  newlinechar There already being a weapon named the Bulldog is a legitimate point, which makes me wonder why it's not much more than an afterthought in the OP. That said, it's not as if it's not something that happens in real life (for example: [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Bulldog), [2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_Arms_Bulldog)). newlinechar  newlinechar IDK, overall I like the name. I see valid reasons to change it and equally valid reasons to keep it, I wouldn't be opposed to either outcome. CIG will do what they think is best and I'll be happy with it.

Sure, you can. But they generally go a lot better if you're partaking as well. It probably doesn't make sense from a pure cash outflow analysis now, but for me it goes into greater relationship building that ends up directly affecting my salary. There's something to be said for the social effect alcohol has on building relationships. I have to deal with my boss in a very professional manner 95% of the time I'm around him, but he's good about cutting back and building our relationship personally when he takes us out to bars. This ends up affecting how we interact when we're back at the office. If he generally likes me as a person outside of work, it makes dealing with the things that come up inside work a lot easier, and usually translates into him being more willing to invest time into teaching me which helps me perform better and meet his expectations more easily. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, for client expenses it's always covered. At training events with my peers it's more hit or miss. At this stage in my career, it's an expense I don't mind having. As I get into my 30s this will definitely shift, but I have a ton more people to meet/work with. Free booze is the modern day mana from above. I won't argue with that!

Not going to know you are a girl if you don't bring attention to it. If a group of friends knew you were a man before becoming a women then it's different but if you find new people they won't know. Either way you shouldn't give a shit about others caring if you are male or female

Most Northerners don't. I have a friend from New York. He invited some of his friends down to visit. We decided to take them to Deep Ellum in Dallas. We got in the car, headed out. After about twenty minutes one asks from the back seat, 'what state are we in now?' 'Texas man, in about another ten minutes we will cross the county line.' 'Wow, how long would it take us to get out of Texas?' He asks. 'In this direction, about three or four hours. Depending on traffic.'

Absolutely. I'm bummed because, otherwise, I thought she was wonderful. I'd never met anyone quite like her and was hoping we would at very least be friends. I felt there was definitely a romantic spark between us--but I couldn't get past the nagging part of me that suggested the old axiom 'if she wanted to spend time with you, she would make time for you.' I guess I kind of always knew this might happen, but I'm upset at her choice of method. To maintain contact for 4 months and then just vanish one day without warning is pretty lame.

I'll start us off I suppose, a fairly long time ago me and my boyfriend went to a swinger party where I had met a really nice girl. I've never really been into girl on girl sex, I find penis-less sex less than appealing, though I've only ever tried it myself once. Skip forward to when me and this girl, who I shall call 'Megan' in bed, I'd taken off her pants, and after rubbing the middle of her panties, found a rather peculiar shape from the inside. After pulling them down, *PLOP!* out came a penis. newlinechar  newlinechar I freaked out and ran to my boyfriend (Who was waiting in the living room), as if it was some kind of roach as I was a helpless school girl. A minute later or so Megan came out crying, deeply hurt by how I reacted.

No doubt you're still better. Levy stands out an obviously better LB than anyone on the Bears today, even if you still count Briggs. But the Bears DL I think is comparable to the Lions without Suh.

Its pretty often.  I mean there has been at least one batman related comic about Gotham's mystical side in print since early 2000s (Batman: Dark Knight, Batman Eternal, etc.).

Right, the same way you would when you play it normally on your PS4.
I just can't wrap my head around that happening though. In the comics, Daisy, Black Widow and Fury are the only agents with level 10 clearance, or something to that affect. Daisy is *fiercely* loyal to Shield, so we know she would never betray the good guys, and that's all good and great! I have a feeling on the other hand, this subreddit is trying to hard to introduce Ward as the epitome of evil in the show. And for Ward to be so blinded by an obsession that he thinks is true love could make him the true threat of a season or two is too easy for the writers, not to mention in my mind, is somewhat unrealistic. If Wards thinks his true feelings of love for Skye are real, then all those moments where we see him improve when Skye is around and redeem himself do not point in the direction of someone descending into a fit of madness and the desire to murder. It makes Wards character childish, and I don't believe that's what Ward really is. Personally, I think that now that Skye has shot Ward, and proven that his endeavours to win back Skye are fruitless, he will simply leave from her life in silence. Over the rest of the season, with Agent 33 by his side, I think he will be realistic with himself and try to rid her from his mind as best he can, though that's not to say I think we will succeed. I believe he will always have feelings for skye, but he will just be able to control and understand them better. newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR Ward won't be a 'Super Villain', he will finally try to give Skye some distance and God knows where that will take him

That makes sense. At the same time, if you're already doing all the work of online advertising, deviantart, facebook etc, wouldn't it be a bonus for people to be able to come in and look at your artwork? There are plenty of home businesses that do well while having a home location (I'm thinking cleaning or metalwork or mechanics etc). I don't see it so much as an end-all be-all without any sort of advertising. I just wonder why it wouldn't be an added bonus on top of selling your work online if you're not able to get into galleries/uninterested in selling in galleries. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I forgot to add to your point on cheap shared space.

&gt;I'm going to speculate wildly and say that under 20% of RDR posters have read 20 pieces of literary fiction in their lives, and under 1% of r/writing posters even know what literary fiction is. But everyone reads genre fiction, so it's much easier to get worthwhile feedback, even if it's just a personal opinion. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's interesting that you brought this up, because I noticed that there's a substantial amount of animosity towards literary fiction / MFA writers here (even more-so in /r/writing), and that people conflate MFA work with 'cookie-cutter narratives' and 'purple prose', when in fact –and just look at recent graduates from the Iowa Writer's Workshop– many of the best (and most original) writers today have gone through the MFA system.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's upsetting to see the general ignorance in this sub (and of course, the internet as a whole —this is already a very well-maintained garden), especially when novice-level attempts at literary fiction are met with half-serious 'oh you must be in an MFA program' comments. And then! To think that these same commenters have only published KDP Singles, if at all —and have yet to attract an agent, or complete a book / movie deal with a publishing house, or have their work looked at by a professional editor, or win a single grant, honor, or award for their writing (NONE of which requires that you 1) possess an MFA, and/or 2) write literary fiction). It's enough to give the literary fiction writers on this sub a persecution complex.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is primarily why I was speculating about the possibility of a smaller, more focused sub. There has to be at least ~20 of us out of the 4000 here right? newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

We altered racist and sexist books and media by censoring the content. For example the N word was removed from huckleberry Finn. This is an was change because it simply requires deleting a single word. Where as inclusivity for lifestyles that do not align with those presented in the hypothetical novel would arguably alter the content the author was intending to portray. This could be seen as changing the underlying meaning of the novel which I see as as big of an issue as a heteronormative society. I am adamantly against censure for any reason especially when reframing the context of a novel so that a child or student understands it isnt representative of modern society is a cleaner solution. newlinechar

Generally what people say when they talk about progressivism in politics. Greater acceptance, more working together as a society, etc. Any thoughts that people consider new and morally correct. I'm not arguing against that, I'm just saying people will use it as justification to get angry at people who don't have the same political opinions as them.  newlinechar  newlinechar The more I think of this the more I realize I don't really believe in any absolute politics. Everything is situational and at a personal level. I disagree with a vast majority of people, but I'm not certain I'd say I hate them, just I dislike hatred and conflict and feel the only way to move past that is at a personal level. If people can do that, well that's good for them. Change past anywhere at our current level of incredibly basic tribal politics on any significant scale is, well kinda silly and unrealistic. Before I saw fascism as a way to harness this and make everyone relatively happy and alive, but now, ehhh. I'm becoming less of a dreamer and more thinking about moving into the woods with an echo box of like minded people to an extent where conflict would be resolved by agreement to the right of self, but even then I don't feel much morally better. Maybe the only way to be 'right' is to live as a hermit and be free of any poison that comes as a byproduct to human interaction. But that also seems radical and silly. Or maybe no one is right, and anything will work if people get defensive and tribal enough. And I think I just went full circle to why I'm a fascist.

&gt; the standard library is outsourced to a third party company newlinechar  newlinechar I've poured the last 8 years of my life into VC's STL, do I count? newlinechar  newlinechar As I mentioned at CppCon 2014, licensing Dinkumware's STL in the mid-90s was an excellent decision. In addition to achieving C++98/03 conformance, this made it possible to pick up TR1 and C++11/14 years later. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The marketing never pointed out the HUGE disclaimer newlinechar  newlinechar On VCBlog, I [clearly said](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2011/09/12/10209291.aspx): 'In VC11, we intend to completely support the C++11 Standard Library, modulo not-yet-implemented compiler features.  (Additionally, VC11 won't completely implement the C99 Standard Library, which has been incorporated by reference into the C++11 Standard Library.  Note that VC10 and VC11 already have &lt;stdint.h&gt;.)' newlinechar  newlinechar I do agree that 2012 had a bunch of bugs, for several reasons. The biggest reason was the huge influx of new code (TR1 in 2008 SP1, lots of C++0x in 2010, atomics/multithreading in 2012). Compensating for missing compiler features was another source (e.g. variadic templates). Working Paper churn was also quite problematic (e.g. this led to weirdness in &lt;random&gt;). In 2013, [we fixed](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2013/06/28/c-11-14-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-vs-2013.aspx) many of these bugs (and switched to real variadic templates), and 2015 will contain [even more](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2014/06/06/c-14-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-visual-studio-14-ctp1.aspx) fixes. (I'll be writing another VCBlog post explaining the fixes between 2015 CTP1 and RTM.) newlinechar  newlinechar Also, since people always ask: 2013 shipped almost all of the C99 Standard Library, and 2015 is completing the missing pieces, modulo extremely minor omissions (I could look them up, but I'm on vacation; IIRC it's a couple of the FP macro things, and tgmath.h which is irrelevant to C++).

The League Cup is contested by all teams in the English Football League system (PL, Championship, Leagues 1 and 2) and it runs from August to February.

However the lower league sides have to go through many qualifying rounds until they eventually hit the First Round (which is called the First round proper) which is where the Leagues 1 and 2 sides enter.  newlinechar  newlinechar Eventually they hit the 3rd round and that's where the Championship and PL sides automatically enter (so there are 64 teams in Third Round proper).  newlinechar  newlinechar Matches that end in a draw are replayed about two weeks later at the away sides ground (example, United vs Arsenal ends 1-1 at Old Trafford the replay is at the Emirates) and if there is another draw it goes to extra time and penalties.  newlinechar  newlinechar Unlike the League Cup there is no two legged semi final.

my biggest suggestion is to not use rockin green.  I wanted it to work so badly for us but it really doesnt work at all.  Rockin green products are pretty much just entirely made up of water softeners.  You need a surfactant which is found in most main stream detergents.  What happens is 'dirt' gets removed from what youre washing in the machine and goes into the water during agitation.  The surfactant binds to the 'dirt' sort of like it being trapped in a little bubble.  So when the water drains the 'dirt' goes with it.   newlinechar  newlinechar That being said my biggest suggestion would be to strip them, do a bleach soak, and start using a mainstream detergent such as Tide.

Islam is based on Christianity.

Seeing as alcohol tends to be a lot of sugar, making sure he keeps an eye on his bloodsugars so they're not going too high. Since it's 'partying drinking' and not 'a beer with dinner drinking', it's going to be hard to even roughly guestimate what his sugar intake is going to be through the night. Unless someone has a good suggestion (which I would like to hear, too), he's going to have to take a reaction-based approach to insulin intake, possibly not taking a proper / final correction until the night is done. If the likelihood is that you're going to get pass-out-drunk, it's best to play it cautious with the insulin intake. Having the usual sugar tablets along is a smart move. You shouldn't have to babysit him, just be aware that on top of any hangover he's likely to be feeling the effects a high bloodsugar as well.

Totally agree. I'm on this sub every day and would be absolutely thrilled to become a mod. But the theory from our current one (see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/guitarpedals/comments/2pdq06/i_thought_we_put_a_stop_to_dream_board_posts/cmvxrt8)), however is that the community is self-policing, meaning that problematic posts will be sorted out through downvotes as opposed to active moderation. I don't agree with it, but that's how things are running now.  newlinechar  newlinechar Reddit's moderation policy is that only mods or site admins can appoint new mods. And additionally. seniority trumps all, so that mods who were appointed earliest have say (and can remove) mods who arrived after them.
I want a big man, who can win jump balls. Cooper is only 6'1. White and Parker are both 6'3.  I think we can get Parker late first or early second if we have picks there. One guy who will definitely be available in the second is Jaelen Strong, who is also 6'3. 
My opinion on the matter is irrelevant. Once you leave your moms basement maybe you'll actually realize that there actually other people out there and not just pictures on the Internet.

I'll second this. In some fields, a PhD is a great path to having many exciting and financially beneficial job opportunities. In other fields, it may actually hamper your job prospects because you'll have 4-6 years less industry experience than your peers, yet there aren't really many jobs in the field that would truly require a PhD. Then in some fields, a PhD qualifies you for only one thing: an academic job, in an era where 'academic job' has mostly come to mean 'adjunct with zero job security making less than minimum wage'. newlinechar  newlinechar So anyway, yeah. In some cases, getting a PhD is the best idea ever, but people should really do their research and be realistic about the prospects based on their field and their own situation.

I'm guessing manga books don't count? :P newlinechar  newlinechar I'm a big fan of the movie 5 Centimeters Per Second. It's available fully English subbed [here on Youtube and is only 1 hour long](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVbnt4vQE6w). It can appear to be a boring movie from the outside. There's no amazing people with superpowers or even villains. It's just focused on a story between a guy and a girl who become close friends, but life forces them to move away from each other. It takes place in a time where cellphones weren't commonly in use, so they had to communicate the old-fashioned way with hand-written letters. newlinechar  newlinechar It's depressingly realistic. The title refers to the speed of the cherry blossom petals falling from the tree. They're symbolic of people, because people start out close together like the petals on the cherry blossom, but they scatter and gradually drift apart. The ending is just an emotional gut punch, but I love it because again, it's extremely realistic and based on life. newlinechar  newlinechar It's kind of interesting though because now we have all these forms of social media and the Internet. I wonder if this movie would be less applicable to kids who are growing up now in the age of social media. newlinechar  newlinechar Also the animation is stunning, and I believe handdrawn? I think [this scene](http://thecajunsamurai.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/5centimeterspersecond-5.jpg) from the movie is one of my favorites because the landscape is so beautiful. It's basically scenery porn. newlinechar  newlinechar Happy New Years!!! newlinechar

In other words, this insinuates that the problem isn't the occupation but rather the very existence of Israel that drives the conflict.

Honestly they don't do a very good job, though. From what I understand, they tend to ban in huge waves, which just isn't an effective way to keep the economy stable and free of ill-gotten goods. Right now gold farmers farm until all their accounts get banned all at the same time, then they acquire several new accounts all at the same time and keep their operation going. If Blizzard were banning more proactively and continuously it would be more difficult for farmers to maintain their herd, and it would keep the economy more stable. newlinechar  newlinechar I know Blizzard *does* ban, but I don't think they have chosen a particularly effective way to go about it.

Adam Smith is not the libertarian libertarians would have you believe. He actually had strong views about ending poverty with government involvement. He didnt make a bunch of predictions that never happened.  newlinechar  newlinechar *edit* to answer your question though I dont know.

My pup has definitely lunged at people before. My roommate was making noise in our unlit kitchen in a large black hoodie, and Chief was whining at my bedroom door to go investigate. I knew it was my roommate who had just gotten home, so I didn't worry about letting him out. He lunged at her barking, but as soon as she said 'Hey Chief!' he turned his ferocious barking into his whiney greeting he does when anyone gets home.  newlinechar  newlinechar Another time we had some thuggish kids walking down our street. Chief was growling at them from the window, in typical GSD fashion, when the kids walked into our front yard and started barking back at him. I put Chief's leash on and opened the front door, mostly just to ask the kids to cut that shit out. Chief *lunged* at them snarling, and they ran off before I could say anything.  newlinechar  newlinechar Would Chief had actually followed through with a bite/attack if something (like my roommates voice or his leash) hadn't stopped him?

I am finding so much bad and conflicting information about this case that it feels like my head is about to explode.  newlinechar  newlinechar The latest piece of conflicting information is a doozie. As I'm reading the article by David Lohr I'm thinking *this is great,up to date and he even interviewed a State Trooper that investigated the accident.*  newlinechar  newlinechar Then as I'm about half way through the article this catches my eye: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Hager had been visiting his girlfriend in Fairfax County, Virginia, and had left her home at about 7:45 a.m. on the day of the crash. Later that day, Hager stopped at his father's home in Gloucester County. His father wasn't there at the time, but Hager did call him at about 12 p.m. newlinechar  newlinechar 7:45 am??? 12:00 pm???? I thought this accident happened at 1:30 am!!!!! All the information I saw prior to this article says 1:30 AM!!! Go back to the beginning of the article and read this: newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That's what police found at the crash scene on the afternoon of Monday, June 26, 1995,  newlinechar  newlinechar AFTERNOON????? What???? Wait a minute!!!  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Did you hear that???? That was the sound of my head exploding! newlinechar  newlinechar I think this one can be solved if everyone that is attempting to solve it is working with the same valid facts.     newlinechar  newlinechar I just joined WebSluths in hope of finding some accurate information on this case. I'll post back here when I know I am basing my theories on known facts. newlinechar   newlinechar EDIT: grammar. Hey, don't laugh. It was even worse before.

Chiming in here.  I actually worked on Poxnora as a designer for about 3 years, bridging between Octopi and SOE ownership.  The last part of your post, about power creep, is the biggest thing that will translate into hearthstone if Blizzard doesn't consider it early.   newlinechar  newlinechar The business models for this kind of game demand the release of new cards, they simply don't make much money otherwise.  In order to make the new cards desirable it is very difficult to avoid bringing up the baseline of power over time.  One of the large factors contributing to the decline of Poxnora's balance and fun was the requirement to keep all cards in circulation at once.  This makes it increasingly hard to create new cards without resorting to complex new effects or large combinations of existing effects. newlinechar  newlinechar I think Blizzard should strongly consider breaking the game up into limited play sets as time goes on, assuming they continue with a business model built around driving users to acquire the latest cards.

&gt; It's not so much a catastrophic polarization as it is a slow legitimation of what used to be an absolutely unacceptable agenda. newlinechar  newlinechar To be fair, isn't this sort of a matter of perspective?  The kind of moderate-ish ethnic nationalism you see out of much of the new populist right in Europe would have been 'mainstream' conservative thought a generation ago.  It's also interesting to me that people like Marine Le Pen and Timo Soini seem to be having a lot of success outflanking the traditional center left parties on economic issues.  Many of those parties moved away from the economic left the past 25 years and compensated with more aggressive social liberalism to differentiate themselves from the opposition.   newlinechar  newlinechar I would argue that much of the new support for the populist and far right in Europe is the result of them filling a vacuum the old parties left behind, not some new right wing trailblazing.  Add that to a bad economy stoking anti-establishment feelings and people are less willing to stay loyal to the mainstream parties.

I sound like a broken record. Until recently, 'having sex and knowing the relationship is only or mainly about sex and has no long term future' was called rape.

It's a nice knife. Funny someone would make such a decent fake when they could clearly make an original design with similar quality. The only thing really wrong with it is the pivot needs to be loktited, otherwise it gets really loose rather quickly. Once it's good and tight thought, it flips like a dream. I've owned a good number of flippers and this guy is up with the best of them. The anodizing looks great. clip is a decent balance between easy in/out without chewing up your pants. The blade centering on this one is immaculate. It feels good in my medium glove sized hands, nice and cozy, it'd be pretty hard for it to slip out of my hand. The end of the framelock where it meets the bottom of the blade has a steel bit screwed into place to prevent issues with the titanium. Besides the issue with the pivot, there's really no jimping anywhere except for the backspace, which is okay, this isn't really a tactical knife, but if jimping is your thing, there's not much to be had. I can't vouch for edge retention yet, as I've only ravaged some cardboard and paper, but so far it's held up just fine. Otherwise, this is something similar in fit and finish to a Benchmade from what I can tell.

Well, I didn't think that pun was too *cheeky*.
My argument would be his poor track record most seasons and his unwillingness to adjust his scheme for the players he has to work with. His defense was always predicated on a bend don't break mentality so there weren't a lot of blitzes. In 2011, it worked because we had an amazing line that could get pressure while only rushing 4. This year he should have blitzed more in my opinion because we weren't getting a ton of pressure rushing 4 which gave Qb's time to pick apart our depleted secondary. So while it wasn't his fault that we had a lot of injuries it was his fault that we didn't adjust our scheme to try and cover up those injuries. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, that's a solid username, have you ran it past Carol in HR?

Looked it up - looks interesting.  I never played Cities XL because when I heard about it, I heard the online MMO thing (I don't even know that I knew it had a single-player mode).  So I see that Skylines will be single-player, which is good.  I don't have Steam, but I know Banished was available without it; will the same be true for Skylines.  If it is, do you know if it will require a persistent Internet connection?
Even when you got better loot in Destiny, it just wasn't...fun. The guns didn't feel different or interesting, or change at all through the game. It felt like an MMO, weapon-wise, which maybe is the point, but upping some numbers on your gun slightly every few hours of gameplay is just not compelling.

completely unrelated to this announcement, beyond his method of communicating it.  More and more, I find myself disliking him as a person.  I like his books, Love his charity, but he kind of comes across as an asshole who thinks his farts don't stink (if you understand the phrase).  His foreword in 'Slow Regard for Silent Things', came across as someone saying that 'if you don't like this book, you just don't get it and aren't one of the cool kids'.  I follow him on twitter and he constantly says things on there that just come across as super douchey. For instance, he doesn't post that he thinks the new Hobbit movies suck, but that 'I'm trying really hard not to judge you folks who went to see the Hobbit movies.....'.   newlinechar  newlinechar I'll buy doors of stone whenever it comes out and I'll continue to support Worldbuilders as its a fantastic charity, but I'm just not really going to be a fan of his anymore.

My mom got me one, finally, after months of begging, for Christmas. A Diva cup.  newlinechar  newlinechar To be fair, it wasn't that hard a sell on my awesome hippie mom, but my dad wasn't at all reasonable and that's where the money came from. I would have got it (A Mooncup, actually, seems preferable, and the replacement in roughly ten years will be a MCUK) myself if I had a credit card and didn't find it insulting I have to pay for my necessities at 17.  newlinechar  newlinechar I was actually excited for my period. I'm using it right now, and it's fucking wonderful. It took me literally four hours to get it in the first time (I hadn't read the part about holding the fold *as low on the cup as possible*, and it kept popping open too soon), but I'm on the second day now and you can't feel it at all when you get it in right (admittedly I'm gonna need practice, there is *very* slight pressure when you do it wrong), no leaking (I slept naked last night! No diaper panties! No Japanese sheets! It was a fucking miracle!), and having a mL amount for just how little blood menstruation really is is really cool. newlinechar  newlinechar And not the 'you can't even feel a tampon!' lies. You really can't. And you really can feel confident you won't ruin your panties. Until you get it down pat, even the leaking is minimal, one of the liners you have left over will last the whole day. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar And I've read everything I can on them, and they truly are safe if used with proper care- washing your hands, cleaning it, and leaving it in the cool carrying bag that nobody would be 'haha you're gonna put it in your *vagina* ha ha nasty' in public at a glance, unlike a pad or tampon. TSS, pad rash, heavier flow, exacerbated cramps, deposits and drying, none of that shit.

My little sisters' best friend, who I can say is generally a nice girl, vehemently told me not to dump it in the sink because 'I use that too', like it's any of her goddamn business what I do, and like it would affect her anyway. I can say fuck them and laugh, but I'm sorry to say some people *can't*. newlinechar  newlinechar TL:DR; I am a menstrual cup user and I think everyone should be given the option. They should be more widespread. This wasn't in any of my learning about sexual health even though it's the best.

I think it's really hard, because I didn't grow up with normal clothing.  So one example might be, growing up, empire waists were forbidden, because it was too close to the chest and it would draw men's eyes to look there.  Really most clothing that's not loose and untailored looks immodest to me. newlinechar  newlinechar And psychologically, I often feel like I have the wrong sort of body for modesty.  Like, I feel like a lot of guys see a large-chested woman, they see her as immodest, even if she's more covered than many of her less well endowed sisters.  I feel like I get this from other women too - a lot of people assume I put a lot of work into my 'figure', maybe I'm wearing lots of padding or have implants, or that I'm on a diet and focused on my weight all the time.  And I feel like I don't look like a modest girl, because I'm very thin and have DD's, when most modest women I know don't look like that.

A lot of individuals (like me and you) don't agree. The MVP voters seem to have an understanding, though.

Because we both know that MVP voters vote on most valuable player, and not most exceptional player.

It's literally semantics. :D Synonyms are useless unless they have a slight distinction, after all. But yeah, before accepting a gift the social implications should always be considered.

Basically, every single thing needs an Intelligence to be observing it at all times in order to keep it in a definite form and to direct it/keep it from dissolving back into quantum foam. newlinechar  newlinechar After an Intelligence has been active for a while (I originally wrote 'around for a while' but this is inaccurate, all Intelligences are eternal, but some just kind of sit around doing nothing while others explore their surroundings,) it gains the ability to influence more and more matter and energy, thus ascending towards greater and greater degrees of Godhood. But the more you have influence over, the harder it is to observe every single individual particle. newlinechar  newlinechar So as you ascend in degrees of Godhood, you recruit other Intelligences that are just becoming active to sort of subcontract these particles for you. As you evolve into a more and more complex entity, you recruit more and more Intelligences and organize into more and more elaborate structures and substructures. newlinechar  newlinechar There is a spiritual evolution, each phase of which is coupled with a phase of physical evolution. You organize a more complex spiritual (spirit = plasma/electricity or something very similar) form, then incarnate into a solid form that matches it. After accruing experience in that solid form, you return to a purely spiritual form and take what you've learned (learning is much easier in a material form) and evolve your spiritual body (with or without help, see below,) then re-incarnate, taking on a physical structure that mirrors your new spiritual form. newlinechar  newlinechar In addition to reincarnation, there is resurrection. newlinechar  newlinechar Resurrected beings have the immortality of spirit and the solidity of physical matter. The best of both worlds, without the limitations. Once you reach this point, you are ready to take the next step, which is to assist other Intelligences in obtaining or evolving spirit bodies. newlinechar  newlinechar Resurrected beings can reproduce, and in doing so will create spirit bodies patterned after their own. They can re-organize spirits from lower forms too, for example a dog to a chimp. It's possible, though much more difficult, for an Intelligence to form or evolve its own spirit body (JHVH did this, hence why He is called self-created.) Once an Intelligence obtains a spirit body in this way, it can grow and learn by leaps and bounds compared to its previous state. newlinechar  newlinechar After creating spirit bodies, a resurrected being can fall back into mortality and begin creating physical bodies for those spirits to inhabit. This is what Adam and Eve did. They voluntarily gave up their resurrected state, after populating the Earth with spirits, in order to provide those spirits with mortal bodies so that they (we) could experience the next step. newlinechar  newlinechar As Adam and Eve fell, so too did the Earth, from its former place of glory at the center of the Galaxy to its present position at the tip of the Orion spiral arm. Adam and Eve left the congregation of the Elohim (Hebrew word meaning the Gods, plural, not God, singular) to rejoin mortality for our benefit. Later, JHVH did the same, but whereas Adam and Eve fell to bring death on themselves, JHVH incarnated as the man Yeshua Ben Yusuf of Nazareth to bring eternal life on Adam and Eve and all their progeny. newlinechar  newlinechar The Egyptian religion depicts the spirits of sinners (those whose hearts are heavier than the feather of Maat) being fed to Ammit, the crocodile/lion/hippo goddess of chaos. Basically those whose choices have taken them to a moral dead-end are dissolved back into quantum foam to be recycled; this happens after they are given EVERY chance to take a better path.

Those look a lot like my first attempts too! newlinechar  newlinechar So, through trial and error I learned: newlinechar  newlinechar * Make sure your bottom coat is as dry as possible! You want to be able to smooth out any bubbles without having to worry about messing up your mani.    newlinechar * Make sure your tape is as unsticky as possible. It should be more like applying a window decal. I find shitty dollar store off-off brand tape is awesome for this. You can also apply the tape to your palm to pick up some oil and dirt and stuff to cut the stickiness. Don't worry! I won't transfer to your nails.  newlinechar * Try to keep your strokes going away from the edges of your tape. When you brush up against the tape, you could be squishing polish through any bubbles you might have missed. If you have a lot of lines, you can go parallel to them and it'll help. newlinechar * Plan your lines so you don't need too many coats to get it opaque. The polish that needs the most coats to be opaque should be your bottom coat whenever possible. newlinechar * Along with the tip above, don't let the polish dry for too long before taking the tape off. The drying polish will soften the polish beneath it and you might mess up your design. You should be taking the tape off once the polish is just getting sticky, but is still slightly liquid. It'll keep your it's shape and give you super clean lines. Too dry and you might get chipping. It depends on the formula though, so definitely experiment.  newlinechar  newlinechar These worked for me and the polishes I have. Different techniques work for different people. I have pretty low patience for day long manicures too and I usually slap on a coat of quick dry top coat as soon as I take my tape off and call it a day.  newlinechar  newlinechar

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Graphic Design University, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret branding ops for Fortune 500s, and I have over 300 confirmed logos.

Welding cast is always a pain. The sand used in the casting process always manages to get into the base metal. The metal also has large pores that trap all sorts of crud like oil, grease, coolant, dirt, and who knows what else.  newlinechar  newlinechar You die-grind the area about to be welded and do a hot bead with medium filler, which will look like crap and full of crud and porosity. You then grind all that crap off, and weld again. You keep doing that til you get a GOOD full metal weld in. Then move forward to the next section of build-up and do that again, and again, and again, and again. newlinechar  newlinechar So you actually weld the same area sometimes 4-5 times buttering the base metal til you get good fusion and good metal. Then as you buildup some of the crud floating on the top of your previous bead will cause problems on the next bead, so you float it up to brush/grind it off. newlinechar  newlinechar It's a pain. Lots of wire brushes, lots of die grinding, lots of acetone. It's mostly in the prep work , the welding itself doesn't take very long.

You claim he just sat there with his kids, but if you watch the video he doesn't even know it happened until after people are hit by it. There are only small instances of them on the film after the double spraying.

&gt; What people didn't know about Blockbuster is that I was given free reign to simply forgive any amount of late charges. All you have to do is be nice and have a good excuse. Your kid rented a playstation with your card and didn't return it for 3 weeks? No sweat. Just bring it back and the $300 or so late charges are forgiven. That easy. Wanna be a mean sonofabitch? Well screw you pal. We'll just take it off your card. newlinechar &gt; Blockbuster's stance was that you get more money out of a returning customer than you would being hardline about late fees. Of course, we didn't advertise that... newlinechar &gt; (This pertains to the franchise I worked for. I don't know what the corporate stance would be) newlinechar  newlinechar Are you joking?  newlinechar  newlinechar You sound like you're talking up a policy of one of the most tragic companies in American history. Blockbuster sank like the Titanic so let's not pretend that *any* of their policies were  successful. Particularly the policies of how they treated their customers. newlinechar  newlinechar You're not God as a Blockbuster manager. That's like being the captain on the titanic except about 1000 times less glamorous. If Blockbuster ever charged me for something (in a similar fashion how you claimed you could just write it off or forgive it), I'd simply call my credit card company and refuse the charge.  newlinechar  newlinechar I can guarantee you I wouldn't be paying your charge if I didn't want to, particularly if it's just an afterthought that you could dismiss randomly based on whether someone kissed your ass or not.  newlinechar  newlinechar Look, if the company was worth a shit, they'd still be around. They sucked. They clung to an outdated business model, they clung to outdated media and they refused to embrace technology until it was too late. On top of that EVERYONE HATED THEM.  newlinechar  newlinechar I know lots of people went to Blockbuster for a while but it was out of having no options rather than wanting to go. You do realize how a business like that is doomed to fail eventually, right?  newlinechar  newlinechar It was a miserable shitty company and policies like the one you just admitted to is part of the reason why people were celebrating when it went under. newlinechar  newlinechar Good riddance.
the editing was OK, the plays were fine, but anyone who watches the LCS has seen all of them. newlinechar  newlinechar However the video it self was VERY predictable based off of the music, framing, and filters you put on each scene. newlinechar  newlinechar Ah, sad music and greyscale.

She says if she were to charge him for anything, the only charge would be for running a yellow light based on what happened prior to this clip in the full video.      newlinechar  newlinechar She has reduced the road rage incident to mere speculation despite the video and missed the point entirely with recommended charges. The physical damage done to my car was minor but this whole ordeal has left a sour taste in my mouth regarding the police and our justice system.       newlinechar  newlinechar You try to do the responsible thing by not getting out of your car and escalating the potentially violent situation, hoping that the police will handle it and justice will be served.

Also RIo-Cole 8 turn overs this game... EIGHT!!! newlinechar  newlinechar Our offense also goes to shit as you can see Bosh talking about it.

Hi. newlinechar  newlinechar What do you guys think of a pay-as-you-play subscription style service for MMOs?

&gt; I see, I think I would like it as long as they don't make Hans the main villain of the show or something, in all honestly if they did a spin off I would prefer if they mostly left Hans aside. He was the worst thing about the Frozen season IMO, even though I don't hate him in the movie and the actor did a great job. newlinechar  newlinechar I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again.  It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; yet the OUAT fandom liked more Elsa, deeming that Anna was too goofy at times. newlinechar  newlinechar I didn't get that at all.  I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Perhaps, In the end I just hope they don't drown us on this kind of stuff, more Frozen is good but becoming like the SW AU that no one but the most hardcore could follow due the extensive material there was would be overwhelming. newlinechar  newlinechar I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon.  The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there.

That brings up an interesting question. More likely than not, there are association footballers, track stars, people living in deserted African or Siberian villages who have the potential (numbers and intangibles) to start at some position in the NFL. newlinechar  newlinechar There are 32 starting NFL quarterbacks coming from a pool of 316.1 million. That means that in the US, there is one starting quarterback per  9,878,125 people. There are 7 billion people in the world, or 708 (rounding down) NFL starting caliber guys in the world. Subtract 32 (for those already on NFL rosters) and that's 676 who mathematically could start right now for a franchise. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We have to find just ONE of those guys before Sunday.

Yes: I am strongly disagreeing with that 'point'. I most strongly disagree that 'a phone meeting with... a dozen other members of the ... team' is not one of the most efficient ways to quickly track down a one-off bug involving time-zone/date shenanigans that may involve user environment wrinkles that may require the test machine to be quickly reset for another 'clean' pass at the problem.  You get to keep working and tracking down the issue while talking with the team: **this is a hyper-efficient approach to the problem**. newlinechar  newlinechar If someone comes into my office for an interview and says that this is not an efficient approach for a hot high-priority issue, I have grave concerns about that person.  Maybe you can provide an alternative better solution for 'each team member working directly on diagnosing and fixing their share of the problem while maintaining an instant line of multiway communication', but it's still excellent.  And someone having bad meetings at their company doesn't invalidate what was clearly and demonstrably a productive meeting here. newlinechar  newlinechar We can get into the meta of it sucking for MTGO to have high priority issues on a regular basis, but from a development and test perspective the response was bang-up and the criticism unfair and unfounded.  Give them a break: software is hard enough without throwing in the crazed rules of Magic into the mix.  Someone from the team quickly posting up 'thanks for catching this - we're working on it'?

The fins are stowed on ascent and used for precision landings: newlinechar 'A key upgrade to enable precision targeting of the Falcon 9 all the way to touchdown is the addition of four hypersonic grid fins placed in an X-wing configuration around the vehicle, stowed on ascent and deployed on reentry to control the stage’s lift vector. Each fin moves independently for roll, pitch and yaw, and combined with the engine gimbaling, will allow for precision landing – first on the autonomous spaceport drone ship, and eventually on land.' - http://www.spacex.com/news/2014/12/16/x-marks-spot-falcon-9-attempts-ocean-platform-landing newlinechar  newlinechar The article also links to a couple of related vids. newlinechar

In all seriousness this is probably the best answer so far. newlinechar  newlinechar Curry would be the best ball handler and playmaker LeBron has ever played with, significantly reducing the play making responsibilities on LeBron's part.  Curry's value as a 3 point shoot needs no further explanation. newlinechar  newlinechar Davis is an elite defender and would be the best finisher at the rim LeBron has ever played with.  He also has good range on his jumper and could space the floor when needed (a very important attribute for the PF on any LeBron team).

I really feel like this shouldn't all be put on the OP. The roommate should also be held accountable for leaving her puppy unattended. Obviously no one expects something like this to happen, but puppies have no concept of social cues and can get into trouble suuuper easily (and not just with other dogs). If the roommate wasn't watching the puppy, the puppy should have been someplace safe where it wouldn't get into trouble (chewing on inappropriate items, going potty inside, etc). Similarly, OP should have crated his own dog if he knew Charlie had a history of snapping or knew that the puppy would be left unattended with him. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not saying by any means that it's all the roommate's fault, but these were two dogs that should not have been alone with each other and both owners failed to keep them separated. Should he help out with bills? Probably, yeah. But should he feel obligated to foot 100% of the expenses? I really don't think so.

This I think is what a lot of ppl advocating for horizontal progression forget, ultimately a vast swath of the community is gonna decide on the small handful of efficent builds and anyone who isn't running one of those is gonna get vote kicked from any duty/party finder they join. Horizontal progression is great on paper and opens up a lot of choices but unless each fight is dramatically tuned to effectively give different weights to different abilities, a couple sets will just eclipse the rest. Hell even the small amount of fights that might manage to pull it off will probably just frustrate the larger playerbase 'great i need a specific gear set or else no one wants me to join their X farming party better leave all that garbage on my retainer' etc. 
I don't think it's always a bad plan. They sound like classes for students looking to major in math so that they develop familiarly with mathematical rigor. To my understanding they are to be taken instead of the courses designed for use by all departments and in place of calculus requirements. It may even give students the confidence to tackle other upper-division courses together with their first analysis course.

On Defense, every single starter except for 1 went on to play in the NFL, most of them being high draft picks. newlinechar  newlinechar If we could time travel these 2 teams to the Rose Bowl to play against each other with, say 2 weeks to prepare for the game... I really think it's at least a 50/50 shot for Miami to wint, if not in their favor.

I'm not trying to piss you off and I apologize if you've taken my comments that way. I agreed with you about the brown folks driving and was merely pointing out your errors of geography and faith with respect to where Sikhs live and what their religion actually is. These two points are very common mis-perceptions in the trucking world. Again, sorry for pointing that out. 
Except this wasn't an 'illegal' stop. Cops can pull you over at their own discretion. They don't need evidence or to prove probable cause. A traffic stop is not an arrest. If the cop tried to detain you for an unreasonable amount of time, or if he'd searched without permissions or a warrant, then that would be illegal, but the stop itself wasn't illegal, nor was searching with permission.

Considering how desperate Princess Anna was and how susceptible she was to one magical, romantic evening, Prince Hans could bank on the princess falling into the arms of the closest and only remaining loved one and the two would be dashing off to the altar. Princess Anna would be too heartbroken to place blame on anybody, yet alone her fiance who would have no blood on his hands; such a death would be out of his hands and I would think Princess Anna would later accept that it was for the best.

America has 99 Cents Only stores and Dollar Tree. All things are 1 dollar before tax, usually coming out to 1.07 after (sales tax being 7-8 percent) except on things like candy and whatnot that doesn't have sales tax.

In Letters, Tolkien, talking about a hypothetical occurring when the Ring is at Mount Doom, uses the term 'the Eight', mentioning that the 'Witch-king had been reduced to impotence'. He has been killed, but beyond that he has been laid so low as to be irrelevant from then on. However, it can be argued that being killed didn't release him from the power of the Rings, so he should still be around. He shouldn't find the natural progression of Man into Death until after the destruction of the Ring (some people argue not even then, but I strongly disagree). newlinechar  newlinechar The passage the two of you were talking about, I think, is enough. We don't need to look to other books, just to previous paragraphs. This is actually the second wraith in so many pages to pass above the Hobbits. However, the first incident (where, the clouds still thick, there is no visual description) seems to take some time. Frodo and Sam are described as crouching under a boulder and not speaking for some time, until Frodo finally senses it has passed. Before they start moving again, Theoden is stated to be at that moment dying.  newlinechar  newlinechar With the second passage, the whole scene, a transit from far away . Perhaps a long pause, but still just that, with no indication by the author that any great deal of time has passed, like in the first Nazgul's flight. Even seeing it before they feel it (as was the only indication of the first), there's a speed that marks it as something different. The second passage ends with the statement that the Lord of the Nazgul is dead, and from the pronouncement appears to be making the same sort of claim of immediacy as it did with Theoden. newlinechar  newlinechar Given that, I lean more towards his interpretation. But I'm not going to say it couldn't be one of the other Nazgul flying like a bat out of hell to report. There's simply too much attention drawn to it for me to think we are witnessing anything left than the death-visage of Lord of the Nazgul.

You started this game after the new mechanics have been added. That adds a much steeper learning curve than most of us who started earlier. Tip: Download iZurvive and make sure you have a compass in game that is worn or pristine. (Look in fire stations). On iZurvive make a waypoint where you are and where you want to go. The correspond line will give you and ETA and it will give you a directional degree between 1 and 359. Then pull up your compass and line up in that degree. Once lined up double tap alt so you can lock your camera and auto run until said destination. PM for help if needed

If it makes you feel better, there have been times when I have been completely drunk and said things that I would never in a hundred years have every thought to say!! And the next morning, I wouldn't even remember. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, when I first started dating my boyfriend, his mom got into an accident and he was really worried about her. I was also worried about her since my boyfriend seemed so distressed about it. But for some reason, after I was really drunk one night, I told him that I didn't believe that she was really that hurt and he ended up having to convince me by showing me a picture of her in the hospital. newlinechar  newlinechar The next morning, when he told me what I said, I was mortified! There was never a point when I doubted that his mom was hurt!! **I am so happy he told me I said that though so I could profusely apologize.** newlinechar  newlinechar So, at least in my experience, sometimes alcohol can make people say craaazy, absurd things that end up being hurtful.

I didn't say anything about present day dungeons in what you were responding to (despite me believing that).  I said 2.0 runs.  My initial post said they destroy them in speed runs, which they do from what I've seen.  If you parse in the latest extreme dungeons, WHM is consistently way higher dps than sch if both are being played optimally.  My runs have also finished minutes faster than compared with skilled SCH's in game.  If I wasn't at work I'd share some of the parses given to me by people running them during the tests; but I'm sure if you did the same tests you'd get similar numbers and times.  The best new dungeon to speed run is Qarn imho.  The worst being Snowcloak (due to constant forced stops). newlinechar  newlinechar And while I'm not saying it's impossible, I never saw a group with SCH instead of WHM clear faster than 10-11 minutes in WP back then.

So, let me put it to you this way... right now, you're looking at a high-end overclockable CPU (which you're spending extra for, by the way, without buying a cooler!?), and to go along with that you're buying a shit low-end video card. So, the result of that is that this CPU is going to just sit there and go to waste, while the video card will be huffing and puffing, straining at the seams. newlinechar  newlinechar Drop the CPU down to a non-overclock i5-4460 or 4590, and bump the video card up to at least a Radeon R9 280 or 280X, and you'll be playing every modern-day game at a smooth 60 FPS on High/Ultra settings -- for nearly the same price. If you stick with the build you have already chosen for yourself, you'd be lucky if you got 30-40 FPS on High, and some of the newer games will need to be bumped down to Medium to stay above 30-40 (which is a minimum, by any PC gaming standard). Of course the fact that you don't have a 1080p monitor is certainly going to help you reach higher framerates, but do you really want to limit yourself like that?

If the blower motor is starting before the flame even lights, then there is an issue.  I have never seen a furnace that purposely blows cold air through the house before the burners light  newlinechar  newlinechar  The inducer motor should start, ignitor, flame, then in about 1-2 minutes the blower should start.   If the blower doesn't start in about 2-3 minutes, then the limit will reach temperature and kick the flame out.

Okay, I think I know what bothers me about Yas's W and passive. newlinechar  newlinechar Yasuo's passive, Q, E, and R *all* create the cohesive image that he interacts with disturbances in air currents. newlinechar  newlinechar His passive gives the sense that 'Flow' is something that can be acquired and disrupted, right?  He gets Flow, and protective wind surrounds him indefinitely until his flow is disrupted, at which point it becomes turbulent, and dissipates shortly afterward.  How does it work?  I don't know, but I feel like, by moving through the air, he can sense what it's doing and sort of 'fit into' it, and that's what creates the normally-invisible shield.  When it's disrupted, he exploits that disruption to prevent damage to himself. newlinechar  newlinechar When Yasuo uses Q, he's also doing *something* with air currents, because it takes 2 of them before he's ready to use the tornado with his third.  Maybe he's reading the currents with his first 2 stabs, maybe he's priming the air (so more writing than reading) with them.  It makes sense, because something changes if he doesn't use the conditions that he's created within a few seconds: all of the prep work goes away, fickle as the wind.  If Yasuo stabs again, though, he can exploit some created or detected disruption in the air to create his tornado, similar to what he does when creating his shield. newlinechar  newlinechar Yasuo's E is a bit more proactive, in that, instead of exploiting an existing disturbance in the air, he forcibly creates one, and that prevents him from using the ability again.  He enhances his movement speed by slipping through the air *just so*, but can't do it again for a certain amount of time because he's changed the air he moved through.  This is why he can E again and again, as long as he has an air current he hasn't already disturbed: the limit isn't with Yasuo, but in the time it takes the air he's disturbing with his dash to return to normal. newlinechar  newlinechar What's more, while this disturbance is being created, Yasuo can exploit it: he can perform sword maneuvers that are beyond his normal abilities (the spin), and create a significantly-larger-than-normal tornado, though it doesn't travel. newlinechar  newlinechar When Yasuo's ult is ready, displacement effects give clear visual queue that they're creating, you guessed it, a disruption in the air that Yasuo can, you guessed it, exploit to benefit himself, this time in the form of extremely rapid movement (presumably aided by the disruption in the air), suspending his enemies in the air, and finally, gaining armor penetration, represented by a disturbance in the air around his sword.  There's a disturbance in the air; Yasuo exploits it. newlinechar  newlinechar His W is the only thing that doesn't fit.  While his E also forcibly manipulates air, it retains his common theme: he can use that disruption to benefit himself (enhanced Q) in some way.  With his W, however, he creates the disturbance and that's it, end of story.  He can't interact with it in any other way, and it's the only air-based ability in the game that he can't interact with (unless you count Janna's shield). newlinechar  newlinechar **TL;DR: Yasuo exploits and interacts with air disturbances, except the one created with his own W.**

Round 1 I would give to Azula 6/10, assuming Pikachu is taking orders from Ash, the lag between them would give her a big lead and make their attacks predictable.

This is an amusing post; and I feel like a lot of people making similar posts about ED on here these days would do well to look back on that.  :p    newlinechar  newlinechar Back in those days, it took me something like a day of playing to complete my first successful flight from lave to another system, including docking.  But once I did it once, then it started getting *a lot* easier.   But you had to work to earn that sense of accomplishment.  It was *hard*, and so you really earned the satisfaction of even that simple achievement.   newlinechar  newlinechar And at that point, a whole galaxy...eight of them, actually...opened up before me.   And I was hooked;  I didn't stop until I made *ELITE*.    I was a bounty hunter, a smuggler, a pirate, a pawn and a theif, and occasionally even an honest trader.  I would do the Reidquat run as a warm-up, and then look for a *really* dangerous system to hunt in.  Basically, I practiced until I was actually good at it, instead of quitting just because some feel-good sense of 'winning' wasn't handed to me on a platter like games of today do.   newlinechar  newlinechar Back then games required real skill, and if you couldn't cut it, you lost the game, period.    And a little imagination helped, too; wireframe, or simple solid-colour polygons give you a canvas, and your mind had to fill in the details.   That is not really encouraged as much in the big games of today.    newlinechar  newlinechar And for God's sake, if I see another post about how Elite is bad and should be more like WoW or Eve, I am just going to have to murder someone.   IF you think either of those things, it simply isn't the game for you, you know?    newlinechar  newlinechar I wonder if any  other old-timers are kicking it in Bebece these days?  Is that system even in ED?  I guess I'll have to take a look.   newlinechar  newlinechar

[](/dirtytwi)2014 was an up and down year for me, with an equal amount of positives and negatives.

The more possible passwords you have, the harder it is to guess. You can measure that as bits of entropy, the amount of bits (1s and 0s) you'd need to store every possibility. newlinechar  newlinechar Assuming a completely random string that uses any printable ASCII characters, each new character adds 6.570 bits of entropy. With 18 characters the OP mentions, that's 118.26 bits of entropy, which the OP feels isn't enough - he wants to add more characters to the mix, increasing the number of possibilities and thus the 'value' of each character, so to speak.  newlinechar  newlinechar For comparisons sake, according to an estimate made in 2011, 72 bits of entropy would take well over a hundred years to guess, and it gets exponentially more difficult the more bits you add. 118.26 bits should be more than enough for anyone's needs. newlinechar  newlinechar I totally cheated and used wikipedia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR: Special characters will make your password safer, but you don't really have to worry about it unless you're a cryptography enthusiast.   newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: I copied a value incorrectly, 118.26 became 187.26.

Maybe it's trivially easy to find men because... the man doesn't have to carry the child inside of him? newlinechar  newlinechar Like, look. I have admitted that it's 'unfair' that biology 'privileges' women by burdening them with a nine-month pregnancy. Both parents have the same options most of the time: Don't have sex if you don't want a pregnancy to ensue. Give the child up for adoption if you don't want to raise it, and pay child support if the other parent raises it. newlinechar  newlinechar But only women (and a very, very small number of men) have to actually deal with being pregnant, and because women are the ones who get pregnant, women are the ones who decide whether or not the pregnancy continues. This is because it is completely unfair to make a woman carry a fetus to term if she doesn't want to, and it's equally unfair to subject her to abortion (an invasive medical procedure) without her consent. newlinechar  newlinechar If cis men could get pregnant, they would have all the same options here. MRAs constantly talk about how it's 'just biology' that's to blame for women earning less money, getting raped, or whatever other injustices women have to deal with. But men face one single problem that literally *is* because of biology, and that's horrendously unfair? Get real. newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, my mother actually has told me stories of pregnant single teens who had their children taken and raised by their parents, who later had to pay child support to their own parents (the children's grandparents) when it came to light, but I'm not actually submitting that as an example because it's hearsay and none of those keywords lead to anything useful on Google. (Because most of the results are just men whining about having to pay child support.) newlinechar  newlinechar If I can magically find an example in this cesspit of 'but whyyyyyyy do i have to take responsibility for my actions???' (in b4 'but abortion' - abortion is a valid way of taking responsibility, it's not the 'easy way out' that conservatives like to pretend it is) then I'll come back and link you. But otherwise, I'm done here.

&gt; Technically the item was charged to them while it was still in their possession. newlinechar  newlinechar LOL, you don't understand how banks and credit cards work. TECHNICALLY, the item was RENTED, not purchased.  newlinechar  newlinechar So 'technically,' your argument means nothing. newlinechar  newlinechar It's hilarious reading the posts on here from ex-Blockbuster employees. You guys seem bummed that it went out of business but it was HORRIBLE. And all of these policies you guys are defending is a huge part of why people were celebrating when the chain fell apart. newlinechar  newlinechar I denied a claim from a Blockbuster through American Express once.

&gt;So then they fight the French some more, and then they fight the Americans some more, and at some point human nature is what it is. It's not an argument against anything.

It achieved little because communism doesn't work and capitalism does.  
You've probably already tried, but have you asked them to do a once weekly grocery list, checking everything you currently have before putting anything on the list? I'd also suggest collecting their receipts and totally their monthly expenses. If you have more time, I'd suggest listing everything you throw out early, and coming up with a value based on what is left, putting everything in an excel spreadsheet, and showing them how wasteful they are. That's basically a second job though.

Can't comment on Anderson's defense as 61.7% is pretty bad but he's also on an oddly poor defensive team considering they have Asik and Davis as shotblockers. I'd imagine some of the blame for his percentage allowed has to go on team defense and guards allowing too much penetration. Stretch bigs also aren't really known for their defense to begin with. newlinechar  newlinechar On offense, he's had a down season shooting from 3 at 34%, but last 4 years he's been consistently 38-41% from 3 at 5-7 attempts a game. He's also not even 30 yet, not sure why you're saying he's just getting by on his reputation. Montiejunas is a nice player, but he's not nearly the stretch big threat Anderson is. Montiejunas is 29% from 3 with 1.6 attempts a game... and that's actually his best so far out of the 3 years he's had. newlinechar  newlinechar You also have to look at their impact on offense as a whole rather than their individual numbers. Stretch bigs open up the driving lanes and open up the paint for low post players like... Dwight (Lewis in Orlando).

Actually, the video itself is the context, the word you were no doubt searching for is there is no proof, or other conclusive evidence to suggest that the white kid is the bully. However, using context clues, one can make some general assumptions. For instance, the black kid's behavior does suggest that he is distressed, and taking into account the standoffish nature of the white kid, especially at the end when he tries to save face, not to mention the reaction of the other people present, which is obviously supportive of the black kid, it is not outside the bounds of reason to assume that the kid was indeed being bullied and responded in an appropriate and satisfying manner. Of course, it is impossible to be sure that the above mentioned scenario is the correct one, but I posit that it is probably the most likely of the other available explanations.

But you're missing the impact of the first movie.  That was 2002, before Hulk, Fantastic Four, The Punisher, and subsequent comic book movies that don't totally suck. newlinechar  newlinechar At that point there was only X-Men, and before that the unwieldy period of 70s movies and the shameful resurgence of licensed movies like Batman &amp; Robin that stigmatized them.  So this is one of two movies responsible for rebuilding the genre and bringing it into the modern age. newlinechar  newlinechar And as one of many people who saw it at the theatre, there's no substitute for that first time watching it and seeing Spider-Man _move_ on screen like straight out of the comics.  They nailed the sequences of him swinging over the city--it's really only comparable to seeing the original Superman. newlinechar  newlinechar Now days it's so easy to judge it by the casting and compared to all the modern movies like Avengers and Guardians.  But twelve years ago, Raimi and co. brought the characters to life like never before.

My advice to not wasting time and money on square bitches is to focus on bitches that like YOU rather than bitches that you like. As soon as you've made a connection with them, profess your feelings for them first. If they get all gushy over you telling them that you feel a strong connection with them, then pull back a bit and get them to chase you. On the other hand if you tell them you feel a strong connection and they're like 'yeah whatever BUY ME SOMETHING' then you know they're trying to get you to chase them and most of the time, no matter how fine the bitch is, it won't work between you. newlinechar  newlinechar If you play things too slow waiting for them to build up a connection with you, it's a hit or miss game and you can lose a lot of time and money in the process. On the other hand, as soon as you feel you've put in a bit of quality time, if you right away tell them you feel that strong connection, you'll probably end up losing a large amount of your prospects in the process, but at the end of the day you're weeding out the ones that are too much trouble or effort in the first place. 
I'm far from these people when it comes to this story. I just can't understand this Transgender stuff. I just think if you got a dick you're a guy and if you have a vagina you're a girl.

I don't really see Raikkonen as that controversial. Most fans would rate him as a driver that in his prime was very good, but not up there with the absolute best like Schumacher and Alonso.

Most people who bother with the matter at all would admit that the English language is in a bad way, but it is generally assumed that we cannot by conscious action do anything about it. Our civilization is decadent and our language -- so the argument runs -- must inevitably share in the general collapse. It follows that any struggle against the abuse of language is a sentimental archaism, like preferring candles to electric light or hansom cabs to aeroplanes. Underneath this lies the half-conscious belief that language is a natural growth and not an instrument which we shape for our own purposes.

Considering pretty much every civilization over thousands of years has had something against the Jews, it makes you wonder what the hell they do to piss people off so much.  Hell, the reason they've become so associated with money handling is because in the middle ages, the church didn't let Christians lend money with interest, so they **forced** all the Jews to get into that line of work.

I don't know why but this feels like the least flattering recommendation I have read in a long time. Don't get me wrong, *Learn You a Haskell* may be *the* way to go. I am concerned for the lack of exercises to accompany it, though. Additionally, and I know this may just be pickiness over the style, I feel like it 'tries too hard' to be funny. Some days I don't mind attempts to be funny. Other days, I just want to get right to the point. Plus, if I recall correctly, didn't someone recently criticize *Learn You a Haskell*'s english style as 'broken to the point of unreadable'? Or am I thinking of something else?

His TARDIS will be a major advantage. newlinechar  newlinechar **Superman**, the guy who can benchpress planets, heat vision, freeze breath, sun-dipping, etc. newlinechar  newlinechar **Thor**, Norse god of thunder and wielder of Mjolnir. Supposedly he can only die during Ragnarok at the hands of the Midgard Serpent. newlinechar  newlinechar So, who wins? I'ts close, but I think team one takes it.

Alright. newlinechar Then why are you complaining about the heavy doing that? If he was messing around, and if it was a pub, then it's all cool isn't it? Never questioned your intellectual level, only questioned how good of a medic you are. newlinechar  newlinechar It is. You obviously don't have enough experience to even start comparing the medi gun to the quickfix. You can still defend with an uber, krtiz can be more agro, the vaccinator goes along well depending on the enemy specifically. The QF, on the other hand, is just an all around medi gun. Good medics don't keep everyone alive lmao, you're talking about nice medics. Good medics have heal priority, who to give up to achieve an objective, capture a point, who to uber, when, knowing your way out, countless are the things that make you a good medic. I could write a book with such things. newlinechar  newlinechar In a serious environment where you can communicate with your team, the QF is utter trash and shouldn't even be used if the enemy aren't braindead. Enemy spy can check your medi gun and tell the medic who will proceed on to pick kritzkrieg. A kritz demo makes the QF's uber a joke. newlinechar You can hold off enemies with stock as well, if you have good mobility, positioning, surviving should not be an issue. As I said you can't keep everyone alive as a medic, you have to take the right decisions, and this is what makes medic a jewel, you're not there to keep everyone alive hurr durr i iz gud medic, no. A good medic paired with decent players can be devastating. If your team is shit, and if you always play with braindead players, then I feel sorry. But since I know you don't, and that the QF can be replaced at really any moment with the medi gun IF you have an ounce of gamesense, then you should use it. newlinechar  newlinechar Look, pal, it ain't that hard to keep people alive. I've had to keep at multiple times up to 5 players alive all at once, you just have to keep healing priority in mind. It's not rocket science, and IMO using the QF overall is an excuse because you're justifying your lack of skill as a medic to compensate for mobility, positioning, and not being able to accept mistakes you'd make with the medi gun.

&gt; Sure they do. newlinechar  newlinechar No they aren't. Not even light works the same way. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It was virtual. Whatever was creating it created it from x point, and his hand contained the virtual gravity inside his hand because it wasn't real gravity. That said I don't know the context of that feat only that it exists. newlinechar  newlinechar If the gravity can't go trough physical things (like superman's hands) then why not just throw it on a box or a room? Zero fucking sense using our understanding of gravity, dude. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Easy. The pages don't exist in this world, but exist in a different dimension. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't understand what you're trying to say or imply with that.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Unless the magic becomes exponentially more costly. newlinechar  newlinechar What part of infinity aren't you getting? infinity minus X is still infinity no matter what number you put on X. The spell has to be an absolute that makes the weight be constant, not a thing that is more costly depending on how many times you use it as those would essentially be divisors, infinity divided by any finite amount is still infinity.  newlinechar  newlinechar Negating infinity isn't something that requires repetition because the point of infinity is that it never ends, stacking spells that reduce its weight a bunch of times would essentially be useless because infinity minus anything but infinity is still infinity. If they used infinity then the book had no business being so heavy for Superman to struggle with it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Think of it like file compression. You can compress a 10 gig file into say 1 gig, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it smaller. newlinechar  newlinechar I know that is what you were trying to say, but you can't compress an infinite file, reduce it by 1/5 of its size and it would be still the same. The logic you're applying only works with constants. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They can make magic compress infinite weight into a 'manageable' weight, but it becomes SUPER fucking difficult to get it less weight. newlinechar  newlinechar Zero fucking sense. For the concept of infinite 0.00000001 is indistinguishable from 10^99^99^99^99. If you managed to make something infinite weight less than infinite, it would be a piece of cake to reduce the weight of anything to almost nothing. Is not like you're worrying about losing data like in file compression, the data in this case is on the pages not on the weight. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, something you haven't used for an argument would be way more simple, maybe the person that casted the spell to make its weight constant, made it to weight as much as he could possibly lift, but I don't know who casted the spell on the book that you're saying it has.

I know 6-7 teams can still make bowls.  Not sure if Colorado would get the exemption though.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit:  Found the rules for what to do after all normal eligible schools have been taken. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 1.  Teams finishing 6-6 with one win against a team from the lower Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), regardless of whether that FCS school meets NCAA scholarship requirements. Until now, an FCS win counted only if that opponent met the scholarship requirements—specifically, that school had to award at least 90% of the FCS maximum of 63 scholarship equivalents over a two-year period. In the 2012 season, programs in four FCS conferences cannot meet the 90% requirement (56.7 equivalents)—the Ivy League, which prohibits all athletic scholarships; the Patriot League and Pioneer Football League, which do not currently award football scholarships; and the Northeast Conference, which limits football scholarships to 38 equivalents. newlinechar  newlinechar 2.  6-6 teams with two wins over FCS schools. newlinechar  newlinechar 3.  Teams that finish 6-7 with loss number seven in their conference championship game (that has been eliminated by the conference championship waiver rule). newlinechar  newlinechar 4.  **6-7 teams that normally play a 13-team schedule, such as Hawaii's home opponents.** newlinechar  newlinechar 5.  FCS teams who are in the final year of the two-year FBS transition process, if they have at least a 6-6 record. newlinechar  newlinechar 6.  Finally, 5-7 teams that have a top-5 Academic Progress Rate (APR) score. This was later adjusted to allow other 5-7 teams to be selected thereafter—in order of their APR. [11] newlinechar

I bought the rucking kit: sternum strap, carabiners, source bladder, etc. I like the sternum strap. I think it was a fair deal, even if I'm not using all the extra stuff that much. I will probably use them one day.  Anyway, I pay for the convenience of getting all wrapped together and sent it to me in the same shipping that the GR1, which, for my small time window on the US, was very important. newlinechar  newlinechar Do you have any nice hack for the GoRuck that you would like to share? If your trip takes you on an airplane, how do you lock your GR2 in case that you have to check the baggage? Because I want to travel with my GR1 *and* my Leatherman Charge, which has a blade. Airport will force me to check the GR1. I don't want to make my GR1 inexpugnable, just a little more annoying for the curious baggage handlers. The only thing I can think is zip ties.

I really appreciate this article, and I really empathized with the author when he talked about the 'hidden code' of liturgy. newlinechar  newlinechar In my lifetime, both as a child and an adult, I have visited about 50 churches.  If the order of worship is not A: spelled out in the bulletin/pamphlet, or B: clearly enunciated by the pastor, it is very easy to become lost.  And, if you make any misstep, you feel self-conscious and left out. newlinechar  newlinechar I think many churches, both reformed and unreformed, use this habitual, 'hidden code' liturgy as a way for the congregation to bond over this shared, undefined habit, i.e. who's 'in the know'.  To me, this is almost gnostic, and serves to create a feeling of insiders vs. outsiders. newlinechar  newlinechar The congregation should be able to bond over their shared love of Christ, not who can memorize and perform the public 'secret handshake' ritual in absolute silence. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I really appreciate the author's gentleness when he spoke of his colleagues who made some very racist statements.  'African-Americans don't want liturgy, they want to be free to express themselves' comes across as imagining all black churches to be lead by James Brown, and all singing and dancing to resemble 'Soul Train'. newlinechar  newlinechar The author has taken the high road and wrote a series of informative articles, and I appreciate his work.  Thanks for posting this, all 5 parts were a great read!

Well there's a reason mainstream is mainstream and ug is ug. As far as popular mainstream artists we had almost no albums. Kanye, Nope. Drake, Nope (though a fuck ton of singles which were fire) Kendrick, Nope. Jay-Z, Nope. Wayne, Nope, A$AP Rocky, Nope. So nothing from the top popular artists. Then you look at the well known ug mainstream stuff. Nothing from Tyler or Earl. Nothing from Chance. newlinechar  newlinechar Its pretty hard to say it was a good year for hip-hop when most of majority of most peoples favorite artists didnt come out with anything.

I got a chance to get into Mac Miller, 2 Chainz, Rick Ross, PND, and J cole so thats a silver lining in an otherwise cloudy year. 
Generally honesty and rationality will ensure you have a good kick starter. newlinechar  newlinechar Here are some questions you should ask. newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Are you trying to scam people? newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Are you deceptive or dishonest in any way when selling your idea? newlinechar  newlinechar 3) Is your idea realistic? newlinechar  newlinechar 4) Do you have a plan on how you are going to spend the funds? newlinechar  newlinechar 5) Do you have a prototype that properly demonstrates that your idea is feasible, or a well elaborated and supported theoretical basis for your idea? newlinechar  newlinechar 6) Are your rewards realistic and fair? Will they justify people supporting your project? newlinechar  newlinechar 7) Do you have a well thought out timeline for your project? newlinechar  newlinechar 8) Have you properly considered the risks of your project, and listed ways to mitigate those risks? newlinechar  newlinechar These are the main questions I can think of.

I can watch this a million times, and it won't change what happened. Lazar makes contact with Demko *before* the puck enters the net. Specifically, he makes contact with Demko's glove arm, impeding his ability to make a potential save. He also makes contact in a way that impedes Demko from sliding over to the other side of the net, which is where the puck went in.  newlinechar  newlinechar The puck does not go in until well after Lazar makes contact, continues to slide to his right and hacks at the puck. Framing your description of what happened and using words specifically chosen to make yourself seem right don't change what *actually happened.*

I'm not dismissing the impact, that's why I said it's dated *now* ;) newlinechar  newlinechar I still remember being absolutely blown away when it came out. especially as I'd been reading the comics voraciously since '97 when I was 9 years old. X-Men was pretty cool in 2000 but Spider-Man was something else. Think I saw it twice in the cinema and countless times on DVD. Spider-Man 2 I definitely saw at least twice, if not 3 times in the cinema. newlinechar  newlinechar But rewatching it now, it *is* dated; some of the action is hokey, the cinematography is a bit flat, etc. The leap from Spider-Man to Spider-Man 2 is like the leap from Batman Begins to The Dark Knight for me; both in terms of cinematography and overall story, action, emotional resonance, the sequel surpasses the (still very good) original by far. Spider-Man and Batman Begins are a bit tougher for me to watch, whereas I never get sick of Spider-Man 2 and The Dark Knight (though my favourite of the latter trilogy is Rises). newlinechar  newlinechar I find the first two Spider-Man Raimi movies superior to nearly all the MCU films. Not that I dislike the recent Marvel Studios films, I enjoy them (only recently got round to watching them all), but they don't resonate with me emotionally like those 2 films do, and the action sequences are mostly so much CGI mush to me; what I like about them all is the humour (which the Raimi films were lacking, one of the few areas where I think the Webb films surpass them).

That's why MVP should be removed then. What's the point, everyone knows QBs are the most valuable position, it's a bit redundant to have an award that says Most Valuable Player when in reality that means it can only go to a QB almost every time. Peyton MVP of his team? Well no fucking shit, he's the QB. Ryan Tannehill is the MVP of his team but that doesn't mean he was mind blowingly good, it just means he is the QB. (I don't actually know shit about the Dolphins because I don't care about them but I'm just guessing based on the limited roster knowledge I have of their team) MVP is basically 'Best QB' award, and really it's barely even that because Peyton was winning that shit regularly even when other QBs were putting up equal or better performances.

I mean, #3 'Creating Worker Co-ops' is kind of socialist. Not really fully socialist, since he's not talking about seizing the present economic structures but building competing ones, but bringing workers' ownership into the conversation is helpful. And the way #4 'Growing the Trade Union Movement' is described certainly isn't socialist, but the labor movement will be critically important in any future socialist movement, so strengthening it is important. And while #7 may be named 'Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers,' the upswing of fighting the NAFTA or TPP (even for nationalistic reasons) would be a benefit to global workers in sectors that would be marginalized by the kind of free trade that is implemented on capital-owners' terms. newlinechar  newlinechar The way I see it, Bernie Sanders certainly isn't the answer. He's still quasi-capitalist and supports some imperialist policies. If he runs with the Democrats, he'll be telling people that 'socialism' is a thing for liberals and that the right-wing Democratic Party is the place for 'socialists,' which will do a lot of damage. But if he runs in a socialist party, he can help build up a movement that will outlive him. He won't be around forever, and if he's used to make a socialist movement more popular, it can be taken over by genuine socialists. Sanders and Kshama Sawant have spoken together in the past, and as maybe the next most prominent socialist in government (though distant by comparison), she might be indicative of what the next generation of such a movement would look like. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't trust Sanders to be president. He would probably be better than a Democrat or Republican, but I don't play the game of arguing for lesser evils. However, I do think that socialists can use him to bolster the movement, so long as he's got enough of his old socialist conscience left to not enter the Democratic Party.

Some people hold the view that trans people *are* born their gender, and claiming that your physical configuration at birth is all that matters can be transphobic (ie, trans guys aren't really guys because they weren't 'born male'). Cis is better because all it means is your physical configuration at birth and your gender identity have always matched.

Haha! My personal motto is 'Nobody ever looks back on their life and thinks, 'I wish I'd had less sex'.'  newlinechar  newlinechar Unfortunately 20 is a *bit* too young for me, otherwise I'd take you up on your generous offer. :) newlinechar  newlinechar So, I didn't go to school, and it hasn't been a hindrance for me. I figured with the 50k I'd spend on school, not counting the insane amounts of interest, I could get a head start on my investment portfolio. Fortunately for me I was right.  newlinechar  newlinechar It also helps to be able to write and speak legibly: I'm a true believer that the gift of gab is worth its weight in gold. If you can speak to people in a manner they enjoy, the world opens up, regardless of the letters behind your name.  newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, I'm not *against* school, and especially if you live in a country that pays for it, by all means, continue your education. And you're right, a business degree seems like a good choice. Truth be told I was never much good at school (it's hard for me to sit still and concentrate), so it was an easy choice for me to put my money elsewhere.  newlinechar  newlinechar YOU ABSOLUTELY DON'T HAVE TO END UP IN A BORING OFFICE JOB! There are plenty of people who enjoy the solace and anonymity provided by an office job - leave those jobs to the people who love them. Because if you don't, and if you would be miserable in such, then for fucks sake, don't do that to yourself. Even if you have a tough time finding a job - and believe me, I've been there - find something else with which to make money while you search. There are an infinite amount of ways to make cash, and the more you cultivate those, the better you get/the more money you make. For instance, I have flipped furniture, painted, sold things on ebay/craigslist, guest bartended ... really, there are so many things you can do to make money. The notion of 'The American way is to get a job in your twenties and work the same job until you're 65 and get your pension and live in your little house with your little wife until you die' are over, man. We live in a society that now embraces creativity (which they should, as all invention comes from creative thought), and there's so much out there that's just ripe for the taking. Yes, you have to work hard. Yes, you have to sacrifice. And for fuck's sake, be on time to things - tardiness is a sure way to get the boot.  newlinechar  newlinechar

My understanding is that simple carbs have low nutritional value and because you are missing out on the vitamins, minerals, flavonoids, antioxidants etc. is why it is unhealthy for you. newlinechar  newlinechar Specifically talking about the pancreas, I believe sugar does not lead to diabetes (according to my nutrition text book), but is often associated with obesity (which is associated with a lack of physical activity) which can increase the risk of developing diabetes. newlinechar  newlinechar What type of damage does refined carbs cause over time? What illness or diseases can this lead to? newlinechar  newlinechar And thanks if you do take your time to respond!

That was a really interesting article, thanks for sharing. One of the things that turned me away from Christianity were the bible readings we had every week at church. I just remember hearing some of these stories like where everyone in Sodom is killed as if every last person (including, I assume, infants) is deserving of death. Then Jesus comes along and all of a sudden we're all supposed to love each other.  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know enough about biblical scholarship to debate some of the comments. But I find the argument interesting that the bible is our most historical document as we have so many copies. I've often heard that as an argument for the bible's infallibility. What I don't understand is how that in any way solves all the inconsistencies and contradictions within the bible itself.

I agree. It's an absurd charge. But the point is to get the message across that this is not tolerated. I bought my console for 400, and my games 60 dollars each.

And this is gonna sound bad because that word got a bad reputation, but people are entitled to play on their console that they spent money on.

&gt; We were remarking on how all new builds are so big and how it's so weird newlinechar  newlinechar Exactly. Ours is a 'starter home' and yet it's 1200 ft^2 , with an unfinished basement and a 3 stall garage. This is the only home we plan on living in now. Apparently, we'll be having new neighbors constantly since we're just in a 'starter' neighborhood. Ridiculous. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;My husband and I live in a mass produced 'cracker box' very much like the first picture. It's about 1100 square feet, built in the early 50s and solid as a tank. newlinechar  newlinechar I love these neighborhoods, and am jealous of you. We tried to put offers on a couple of the houses like these that were in decent shape, but they were sold literally hours after being on the market. You're correct in that these houses are in high demand. The weird part is that in some of these neighborhoods, people seem to be buying the houses to use as rental properties - and the quality of neighborhoods seem to be going downhill because of it. I would LOVE to see newer neighborhoods with these houses. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;When we first moved in here, we had the typical 'starter home' mentality, figuring we'd upgrade in five to ten years. We only have one bathroom, and while we have four bedrooms, they're small, and their number comes at the expense of a dining room and a living room that can comfortably fit more than us and a few friends. newlinechar  newlinechar Our newer house does have some advantages: newlinechar  newlinechar The basement has a large family room, so that when it's finished, it can fit all of our 'activities' - Our 8 ft. pool table, a gaming/board game table and chairs/couch, and my gun safe. We have those items in the basement right now, it just isn't finished off.  newlinechar  newlinechar The 3rd stall in the garage will be my shop/woodworking area, so all the tools I have from my grandpa will actually be usable. With the small cracker box house neighborhoods, I've never seen more than a double stall, and most of them are single stalls; We want a garden as well, and a lot of the older neighborhoods have a pretty small lot size already. newlinechar  newlinechar When the basement is entirely finished off, we will have 2 more bedrooms and a 3rd bathroom. So, it'll be a 4 bedroom, 3 bath, dedicated laundry room 'starter home'. Still blows my mind that people think they need more than this. I can even use one of the basement bedrooms for a home office if I decide to quit working for someone else. We'll see what happens.  newlinechar  newlinechar ----------------------------------- newlinechar  newlinechar On a side note, 2 of the people that are married that my SO and I went to school with are looking at houses now. They're looking at a $450,000 house, 'but aren't sure it's big enough'.  newlinechar  newlinechar Makes me want to throat punch them.

&gt;Nobody should be forced into parental obligations for a child they never wanted. newlinechar  newlinechar So neither should taxpayers, who by all accounts had absolutely nothing to do with the birth of child at all.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;All people should be forced to pay taxes that fund a great many things, one of which would be a greater social safety net for childre. newlinechar  newlinechar Why shouldn't taxes be opt-in? All I'm pointing out is that you're being exceptionally inconsistent with how and where you apply the principle which forms the basis for your argument. It stands to reason that if I shouldn't have to pay for a child I never wanted, that extends to taxes that pay for said child. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But take a couple who agrees they don't want kids. They have consensual sex but the condom breaks, or birth control fails. The woman decides to raise the child, but the man does not want to be a parent. newlinechar  newlinechar And thems the breaks, I'm sorry to say. Life isn't always fair, nor does it always go according to plan. That you don't get to live the life you wanted isn't necessarily an indication that you're being treated unjustly.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;He should not be forced to pay. newlinechar  newlinechar Why not? Is it not his biological offspring? Why should I be forced to pay for his child if I have to opt-in for paying for children? newlinechar  newlinechar My point, again, isn't that it's a bad thing. I forward it. My point is that switching to an 'opt-in system' changes almost everything around our society and can be used just as easily to argue that I, as a taxpayer, shouldn't have to pay for that child. You haven't demonstrated why the principle only applies to cases that you want it to apply to, but not to others.

Actually a common misconception about cats is that throwing up is normal for them. It's not. I have a 7 year old cat and a 3 year old cat, they never ever throw up. The older one threw up once, and we knew something was seriously wrong, so we rushed her to the kitty hospital at like 3am, and it turns out she had eaten Lilies (the flower). If you didnt know, lily flowers are so toxic to felines that even just the pollen on their fur could result in renal failure. (It reacts to their bodies the same way that antifreeze does). She ended up being fine, but only because we caught it so early and didn't brush it off as 'oh must be a hairball'. After the first two hours of lily poisoning the survival rate goes down to 20%. But I digress, vomiting in cats is not normal. Yes some cats have hairballs, but they really aren't *supposed* to. There are simple home remedies, and food types for them that will stop hairballs. Anyway moral of the story is, if your cat throws up, don't just assume that cats do that- make sure that kitty is alright!

I feel like Netflix series fit street level heroes better than normal films. They don't require as many special effects and they also have a longer amount of time to develop the characters. newlinechar  newlinechar If the MCU does get ahold of Spidey, it would be interesting to get a Netflix series instead of an actual film for him. Or-- if the costs to show Spidey's powers are too high, a Netflix cartoon series? But not one designed for kids or to sell toys, a more mature one.

I'm saying that I think the collective strength of the heavy hitters on the first team is greater than the collective strength of the heavy hitters on the second team. Gandalf is far stronger than Dumbledore for instance, and if The Doctor either can't get to the TARDIS or has it destroyed, his only option is pretty much putting all the energy of his remaining regenerations and exploding. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, yeah, I think Goku could stalemate Superman. But really, Vader/Dumbledore is a wash, Zeus is probably stronger than Thor, and like I said, Galdalf is just a beast and could probably negate The Doctor using the TARDIS.

I'm white and I live in Canada. I've never called 911 in my life, never filed a police report, and never been detained by the police. newlinechar  newlinechar I live in a poor community with a lot of petty crime, but violent crime is almost unheard of, and I KNOW that if there was ever a real problem, the police would respond and deal with me and the incident fairly.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think that's the important difference. My community has faith in the police, and even though there are very few officers patrolling the streets, we know that they will actually respond when we need them to. newlinechar  newlinechar I honestly can't imagine what it would be like to live somewhere where there was gun crime, and people genuinely felt that the police would only make matters worse. newlinechar  newlinechar I hear a lot of comments on Reddit to the effect that 'Don't call the cops, they'll just kill your dog and make problems worse' but this is so divorced from my experience that it sounds insane to me. newlinechar  newlinechar I think that the problems in a lot of American cities are systemic and obviously cultural and racial. It's not fair to expect a police force to be able to sort this out. There needs to be bridge-building between cultures and communities. newlinechar  newlinechar I want to see some wealthy property and business owners walk into the poor communities that exist adjacent to their suburbs and honestly try to engage in dialogue with people. newlinechar  newlinechar We don't need a million man march, we need ten thousand hundred man marches. We need white people living in safe communities to genuinely cross the street and try to understand what it's like to live in a community where the law is scary, police are the enemy, and envy, fear, hate, and prejudice define the relationship between communities and the wealth establishment. newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe then we would see some real reconciliation. newlinechar

&gt; I just don't want it to turn into a long running story where Hans just keeps coming back to try to take Arendelle over and over again. It would get really old, cause they have to go out of their way to make him a believable threat to Elsa, especially if she finally gets some guards who aren't morons/know who they're supposed to be taking orders from so that they don't side with Hans every time he comes in and declares himself king. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, even then, if there was a spin off and he appeared even once to be the villain that would be his 4th attempt already on OUAT's timeline and that is just ridiculous. His last plot was just soo nonsensical...But oh well,before anything is to hope the spin off happens on the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I didn't get that at all. I thought Elizabeth Lail's Anna was pretty universally liked, even among OUaT fans who generally hated the Frozen arc. newlinechar  newlinechar Mmm, well I went back to the OUAT fandom giving that the season was over and there was no more spoilers, and at least on the places I hang out, the Frozen arc was actually liked by a majority. Seems the dislike for it faded away as the story progressed, and on the threads about them, Elsa really seemed like the favored one because she fitted more on the style of the show. They did like Anna a lot tough, and her romance with Kristoff, it was just that they preferred Elsa. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I could see it turning into that if none of the books are canon and Frozen 2 contradicts them, cause we already have the Frozen arc on OUaT which isn't canon. The thing with the Star Wars EU is that there are a ton of books, video games, etc, almost none of which are canon and they frequently contradict each other, so there are just a ton of alternate universes there. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah , it was good that Disney made the AU non-canonical when they bought SW. I guess in any case it would be good if a part of the expanded frozen stuff wasn't canonical after all, at least if they start mixing things up. newlinechar

He came racing over and busted me for DUI because I was 'in control of a vehicle' even though I was only grabbing a backpack out and it was blocked in the parking spot by my cab.  newlinechar  newlinechar I ended up having to take several weeks of alcohol abuse classes among other things, because anyone who has more than one drink at a time has a problem apparently. During the classes we covered different cases of people getting DUIs and what could get you in trouble. Obviously don't drink and drive. But don't be in your front yard with your car keys on you if you've had a drink. If you're within a certain distance of the vehicle you're still in control of the vehicle. Don't drink a beer on a hot day while mowing your lawn, a mower is a vehicle. One guy got a DUI while trying to fix his car in his driveway. The engine didn't start, but he was drinking a beer while working on it. One old woman got a DUI after church because someone hit her and the communion wine registered on the breathalyzer as a .01 and she had a grandkid with her. That one was a felony because of the kid. Another person got a DUI after leaving a hospital and driving too slowly. She told the cop she was tired after working a double shift then visiting her sick mother. You can get a DUI if the cop thinks you're too tired, and she got her 2nd DUI that way even though she had nothing in her system. newlinechar  newlinechar Drinking and driving is flat out stupid. But a lot of the laws now are just insane and geared towards making the states money.

I don't interpret it the same way you do.   newlinechar  newlinechar You seem to think that men have this idea that femininity is bad, but I see it more as femininity implies lack of masculinity, which is bad (for men). Society still has an idea of what is masculine and what is feminine and it likes its men and women to conform to those.   newlinechar  newlinechar I'm sure you wouldn't want to be told that you have a manly voice or that you are very hairy, but these are things that a man would probably like for himself. If I said you had a manly face, I'm guessing you wouldn't be too pleased (maybe you would, I don't know you) but if someone told me that, I'd be giddy. The phrase 'you throw like a girl' is misleading (at least as far as I interpret it). On the surface it seems like it means that girls cannot throw, but it is more akin to 'you don't throw like a boy.'   newlinechar    newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know that I can answer the last part. Personally, I don't see why women doing things makes them no longer manly, but I'll do my best to explain what I think it is.   newlinechar  newlinechar As far as I can tell, it is something to do with it no longer being masculine. If anyone can do it, how is it masculine? So when a man wants to assert his masculinity, he has to look for something else. The more women start doing traditional men things, the harder it is to find something manly.   newlinechar  newlinechar It's all very silly, but things like this always are. I try to avoid those mindsets but none of us are immune from it. We're all just trying to find our way in a world filled with people telling us how to do it.

Oh man, high school. I was once sent to see the principal because a teacher saw me put my hand to my mouth and assumed I was ingesting some imaginary drug-- I had wiped my lips with a bit of napkin.

In retrospect, I can offer the following advice that you are welcome to dismiss: newlinechar  newlinechar * Obtain and wear clothes that actually fit. I know that can be difficult, but well-fitting clothes really do make any build look better. newlinechar  newlinechar * Stand up for yourself. Teachers may be authority figures, but as you implied there are definite limits on their authority, and more importantly there are limits to what is appropriate workplace behavior. 'This is my natural build. If you don't stop harassing me, I'll have to inform the principal.' (Say that politely!) newlinechar  newlinechar * This may be cliche at this point, but it really does get better. Almost everyone in high school is an asshole to some degree or another and eventually most of them grow out of it. In the meantime, try not to be one of those people as well, even if it often seems justified.

That's a bit extreme. I fully believe those parents had empathy for their child. Not only did their views on the transgender differ but the parent feared their child's soul was forfeit for questioning God.

When you see someone destroying themselves, which is what her parents saw, empathy will make you stop them at almost any means.

Exactly this newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe Ricciardo, Vergne and Vettel are the three best drivers in the sport, but considering Newey's track record, we can reliably assume who really won those 4 world champions, since those drivers haven't been team mates with anyone not in the red bull academy. At the same time with Raikonnen, he's been up against a few proven teammates, including Massa, and he did about as well as expected (maybe a little worse, but hey it was his first year in the car again) against Alonso as you would guess when you look at how he compared to Massa, so there wasn't much of a surprise there. newlinechar  newlinechar For that reason I think Vettel is still the more controversial driver, because he hasn't faced a number of known top class teammates, and neither have any of his teammates, so you can't really say how good he is since you don't even know how good his teammates and the former teammates of his teammates are. newlinechar  newlinechar Luckily, that'll all change next year, and if Vettel does anything less than stomp Kimi, the Alonso circlejerk will be full blast :)

What I find interesting about Buddhism is it's versatility. You can find Western Buddhists that don't believe in anything supernatural like reincarnation and see it as mind states - you do lots of good and you feel good (divine), and you can feel ghostly after a terrible deed that leaves you full of guilt. I think Buddhism is a great way of understanding how the world works and how to approach life.

Most cities follow a pattern due to segregation, its actually incredibly common for the south and west sides of cities to be the most dangerous because this is where minorities and african americans resided. Things in those parts of cities were not as well maintained or monitored. So maybe not the world but definitely cities in the USA are like this. If you look at the entire continent of Africa its made up of some of the most unstable and/or violent countries in the world. So to make the joke that Cape Town is the south side of this ghetto of a continent makes sense if you know anything about the world. But obviously you missed a few things during your development as the world changed around you.

The game wasn't willing to let you roam far enough in the levels to create a world. If you found two paths, they both lead to the same area, it's just that one involved more enemies but more loot. It felt like every room had a purpose for gameplay reasons, and anything that didn't serve the gameplay mechanics of the level was cut. To their credit, Eidos did a great job of putting a TON of world-building dialogue, memos, and posters in the world to try to make up for that, but there's still no real substitute for letting the player see portions of the world that exist for reasons other than gameplay. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm disappointed that the hidden cache chain of the City petered out too. That was the best thing they did in the open-world part of the game, completely un-gamey and relying solely on the player's map reading abilities, and they just let it die off.

Replacing both the screen and digitizer is usually really easy. In this instance, it appears the screen/digitizer combo is fairly hard to come by (couldn't find it easily on Amazon), which is why the heat gun/hair dryer is involved (the glass is glued to the digitizer, and both sit over the LCD screen). newlinechar  newlinechar So, replacing just the glass should be pretty easy, just a little touchier. You'll have to heat the glass such that it will separate from the digitizer, then glue the new glass onto the digitizer.

&gt; The whole point of naturalism is to understand the sorts of things that naturally occur, no miracles required. newlinechar  newlinechar Naturalism accepts that the universe can come from nothing and information can spontaneously generate. These are not observable, are based on faith, and are miraculous by definition. Since what is natural is defined by the universe, the universe itself requires something supernatural for its birth. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; The complexity of life arises from a much larger number of simple properties and repetitions. newlinechar  newlinechar So simple we don't understand them. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Perhaps the universe is larger, more chaotic, and more complex than we imagined, but the only thing convoluted here is the approach religious people take when trying to understanding it. newlinechar  newlinechar Right... the convoluted idea that instead of inflating the probabilities for a miracle to occur via an ad-hoc speculation every time we're proven wrong, perhaps this evidence of an intelligent design is suggestive of a designer? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If a deity were 'simple' it wouldn't be much of a deity. I can also use the simple answer 'magic' or 'because' with a toddler, but sometimes a one word answer is no answer at all. newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that He's able to do things far beyond our grasp that we couldn't begin to understand that seems magical to us does not make Him necessarily simple or any less real. The beginning of the universe is magical to us, too, but we don't deny it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I don't have any idea what caused the big bang, so I have no need of faith beyond observation. It could have been an imploding pile of lol-cats for all I know or care. I rely on observation, and stop where it stops, and what's currently observed only points to a big bang.  newlinechar  newlinechar Many including myself are aware that our observations can be explained most eloquently and logically by a designer. To rule out this possibility is to exercise faith. If we have a designer, which is absolutely a distinct possibility by your own admission, then we are His creation therefor accountable to Him. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; You're the one continuing to be dishonest, by having faith in and pretending to have knowledge of huge numbers of things beyond reality and the observable natural world. newlinechar  newlinechar I conclude that the evidence supports God, and I also maintain the Bible as a testimony to His nature and actions. These are testable hypotheses and remain valid with evidence to this day. Choosing not to explore this possibility is the free will of each individual at their own peril.

I'm not sure, honestly. newlinechar  newlinechar When it comes to stuff like Bigfoot, I think it's not plausible they exist as noone anywhere has ever found any skeletal remnants, any remains of any sort (body, tools, cave paintings, etc.). If they've been living and breeding for decades or centuries, there would be remains of some sort. Plus, there'd have to be enough of them alive to sustain continued generations and it would be quite difficult to hide a population of Bigfoots (Bigfeet?). newlinechar  newlinechar When it comes to ghosts/spirits, I didn't believe in any of that until I experienced it myself. I didn't want to believe in spirits and as a kid I rolled my eyes at ghost stories, but when I eliminated all other possibilities (that I could find/think of), and researched enough from all over the world, I concluded that we are beings of both corporeal and non-corporeal energy.

So it seems we're clamoring that the shotgun isn't useful and needs to be buffed. But everyone's treating the symptoms of problem and not the core problem itself.  newlinechar  newlinechar * Heavy's burst damage is limited because of the ramp-up penalty.  newlinechar  newlinechar * Heavy's mobility is severely limited which causes him to get caught out of position a lot. newlinechar  newlinechar * His lack of mobility also causes him to eat more damage as he's limited in strafing or dodging the oncoming fire. This is especially the case when firing/spinning the minigun. newlinechar  newlinechar The natural/historical response to this is to use the sanvich to heal when the heavy has a chance. As long as his team is holding ground and he has cover, the heavy can replenish his health by remaining stationary for a specific period of time.  newlinechar  newlinechar People are trying to make the shotgun more useful, but this doesn't really address the core mechanics of heavy and tf2: newlinechar  newlinechar * Increasing his burst damage or making him a fat scout doesn't in any way increase his mobility - allowing him to still get caught of position. newlinechar  newlinechar * Multiple classes with greater mobility being able to dump well over 300 damage within a few short seconds still leaves heavy at a disadvantage. newlinechar  newlinechar * The problem with the shottie is that you can really only engage 1 person at a time. Compare this to stickies or rockets. A soldier/demo can place a rocket/sticky between two people and significantly damage both of them. Shotguns do not split damage like that. newlinechar  newlinechar * Although the heavy's shotgun increases his burst damage, pushing a corner with a shotgun is an unsound move as there is no telling what's on the opposite side. Previously you could jump/rev and be ready. Now you have to spinup and prefire the corner: giving the opponents time to retreat and allowing you to burn through ammo shooting at a wall/floor. newlinechar  newlinechar Heavy needs a mobility/HP buff to make the shotgun viable. Holding his own against demos/scouts/soldiers/pyros with the shottie is suspect. Even if he kills one opponent, the damage he took in the encounter will likely prevent him from being able to survive the next foe he encounters without a healthboost. newlinechar  newlinechar Prior to the unnecessary, clumsy nerf. Heavy's ability to time ambushes made him able to take out more than one opponent while operating at reduced health. Soldier has the ability to ambush people from high perches he has jumped to. Demo has sticky bombs for traps. Pyro has the backburner and axtinguisher for ambushes. Heavy has a spin up penalty.  newlinechar  newlinechar Simply adding a shotgun or weapon switch times only temporary increases his mobility. But he's still going to soak up damage, and he'll still be at a significant disadvantage to all the other ambush/explosive classes. This is why the majority of players will still equip the sanvich and deal with the atrocious ramp up penalty on their minigun. It's the best option for this nerfed class. newlinechar  newlinechar

Andrew has this nasty habit of jerking his head like he just got shot when he drives and someone puts a body on him. Don't pretend you've never seen him do this. The reason people point to that one is because it was an egregious example that got widespread media attention on major sports sites and blogs. No one documents every single flop from every game. Every team is guilty of selling contact. Some examples are worse than others. It's something to laugh about and generate discussion on changes. It's not something that any team can use to throw stones.

Nope. I totally agree with you. I tried phrasing it exactly like that for the entire first 18 months of her life. The minute I say, 'It really helps if' or 'I've actually had some luck trying' ('luck', I say, as if it's just lucky that I happen to have stumbled upon knowing what works, in an effort to spare his pride) or 'I've found that if you', I get immediately blowback and accused of being bossy. I'm sick of being accused of being bossy. When he gets that flustered, he's sarcastic with the kid and he's sarcastic with me. I can either butt out and let him help the way he wants to help, or do everything myself. I figured out early on that doing everything myself does not make me feel very good, either. :)

TBF, we sit on our labias, so the general idea is that male parts are in the *exact* same place. Considering few women sleep around enough to learn the truth (yay slutshaming), it's a fair point of confusion. Really, it'd be nice if sex ed covered all bits for both genders... but that's asking too much.

TBH I see where he's coming from. Melee's metagame is pretty much set in stone by now, and it's semi-true that past casual level, if you don't play in a particular way, you're going to get wrecked hard. The same is true for PM though. newlinechar  newlinechar Sakurai just wants to put everyone on as equal a footing as possible, which is simultaneously good and bad game design, because it punishes those who actually invest time in the game while trying to make the game more accessible, more noob-friendly. Melee and PM take from that notion, then run like hell in the exact opposite direction, much like games like Street Fighter do. It's a simple divergence of philosophy.  newlinechar  newlinechar There's no right or wrong, objectively speaking; an accessible game is good for sales, and good for newbies (ex: Call of Duty). An elitist game is good to form a community around skillful play (ex: Quake 3 Arena). Unfortunately the latter doesn't exactly bring tons of cash past a certain timeframe, and given that Nintendo cannot just sleep on its hits (because unlike Sony and Microsoft, Nintendo has nothing to fall back on if a console tanks at retail; much like Sega's deal in the days of yore, and we all know how that shit ended), they prefer to get them monies. newlinechar  newlinechar Now I know HAL and Nintendo aren't the same entity (I think ?) and if Nintendo crashes, HAL can still be sold to a surviving company (and pray they don't get the same fate as Rareware), but that still holds true; If they want to keep doing games they like, they better get good numbers for Big N.

Yes, but there are additional effects. For example, heating from the Sun causes the atmosphere to change in size as well, whereas the purely gravitational effect from the Sun is smaller than that of the Moon. I'm not an expert on these things, but the one impact I thought of was radio communication because the [ionosphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere#The_ionospheric_layers) changes from the solar heating and you can bounce certain radio signals off the bottom of the ionosphere (since they don't propagate through). I'd be interested to hear other possibilities for impact.

I think it's your associations that matter, mostly. Linguistically, negatives are not very compelling, but visual stimulation that has a powerful negative or transformational association does. newlinechar  newlinechar I support your experiment and think it's great, especially if it works for you! I'll present a couple ideas for your consideration. newlinechar  newlinechar 3 panel comic sigil, showing the thing, the process by which it is transformed, and the result (symbolically, or sigilized statements) for example 1. You smoking 2. The 'death' of your relationship to smoking. You can depict the spirit of tobacco as you see it, for example. The death of its influence on you. 3. The transformation of the habit to one you would prefer. Like instead of a smoke break, an 'outside breath break' where you take the time to center your breathing and awareness. Or whatever habit you prefer. newlinechar  newlinechar Using death in the sigil statement. 'My relationship to tobacco dies and is transformed' might be a way to get around the negative quandary. 'My awareness destroys my relationship to tobacco.' Don't be afraid to use powerful and evocative words, they may also provide more inspiration for the form of the sigil, as well. newlinechar  newlinechar The underpinning of these ideas is working with the Tarot as a language for sigil construction, because it has concepts of transformation and destruction already visually depicted but inherently lacks negatives, at least from a linguistic process. Haven't fleshed this out yet, I'm sure others have done it.  Just think in terms of processes by which something might change, vs simply saying no.

My little brother has paranoid schizophrenia and when he is on his meds he is the nicest person you will ever meet, but if gets off them it gets real bad. For example, there was a time I was out of work and lost my job and car. So he let me stay rent free at his place, sold me a good car for about 500$ and got me a job. If it werent for that I wouldnt have what I have now. However, last year he was off his meds and ended up going to jail for a year. It was because he was curious what our youngest brother looked like from the inside so he chased him down the road with a knife. Luckily there was a cop driving by or Im not sure what wouldve happened. I would hate to see him on meth or crack. Schizophrenia is some scary shit.

Well, I have a PhD in law. It might sounds awesome, especially in the US, but here where I am it actually isn't. It doesn't mean anything. I work at the univeristy and sure, there is a lot of opportunity. But nothing is guaranteed. Mighjt happen, might not. Getting that position was already a struggle and I know many people would kill for it. Still, it's paid really low. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways. My mom has always been hot blooded. She tells hurtful things and then regrets it, but this time I couldn't take it anymore. I came to my parents for Christmas. My dad is very sick so I needed to help my mom with everything. And I did. I think she was glad I came only because of that. I was my Name Day on Christmas Eve and my birthday on 26th. She didn't give a shit. I didn't get anything from her, not even wishes. She is only nice for me when she needs some help, but she doesn't give anything back. It's the worst when someone is comming over and she wants to show off. The holiday season was full of visits and it got really frustrating to prepare everything, yet not even hear a simple 'thank you'. On Sun we had guests over - a couple with a kid, so she locked my dog in a room. Sure, the dog isn't accustomed to it, but we didn't know how our guests feel about dogs. But they were OK, actually they wanted my dog to be out, but my mom says no, because the dog annoys her. The guests kept peeking into that room, so the dog was barking constantly and my mom yelled at me. I had to take my dog for a long walk despite the darkness and frost. I wanted to go back to my place right then but I had drunk some alcohol so I couldn't. I told her how I felt about it, but she didn't react at all. newlinechar  newlinechar Today she was all nice as she invited four people over and she needed help with preparation. I did a lot, went shopping with her and spent half of the day in the kitchen. She cleaned the living room and locked it as she didn't want the dog to come into it as she would shed some hair... When fist guest arrives the dog was excited (she knows them and they're OK with dogs), so my mom locked her in another room. She started to whine as she was afraid of the fireworks and wanted to be with us. But my mom said no. I said that in such a case I'm going to spend the whole New Year's Eve in the separate room and my mom said she's fine with it, which was really hurtful, as I helped her so much and yet she cared only about the guests. I told her that. Then she said that it's her place and if I don't like it, I can go fuck out of there. So I started to pack myself. She didn't stop me only said that she's fine with it and added that I might as well not comming again any time. She was furious, probably because the guests saw it all. Then she started to cry, but I just left. When my uncle and aunt arrived (I was already on my way), they called me and asked me to come back, but I didn't want to. After I arrived at my place my mom called me and asked if I arrived safetly, then she gave the phone to my aunt who said that my mom is as she is and I should pay no attention to it and just come back. I didn't. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't feel good about it. But it was just enough. I felt like I'm some sort of servant the entire time. I feel unloved and unworthy, not even my mom shows any affection towards me. It all might seem really silly, but actually it runs really deep.

You can snip all you want, but it's a historical fact that most of the natural wealth of Siberia and the Russian Far East was not exploitable, sometimes until after the World War II era. Comparing development in California or across the middle of the American continent to development in Siberia is just not a valid comparison. It really isn't.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm also not talking about stuff that meets the technical definition of arable land. Kansas isn't fucking Siberia. It's ridiculous to compare the two and you know it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Yes I do, and given some of America's potential competitors having been hamstrung by weird internal issues, it isn't exactly notable that the United States ended up on the winning of that. Free trade doesn't have anything to do with this. They were completely free to trade. They fought wars to force the Chinese government into rescinding limitations and protectionism against foreign trade, and made China completely open to (unwanted) Western business, while all the Western nations had policies to build their own industries at the disadvantage of their competitors.  newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that they continue to be unable or unwilling to do much with it in the 21st century bodes poorly for the hypothesis that they could or should have done something differently with it in the 1800's.  newlinechar  newlinechar They didn't choose anything. Societies don't make two or three-way choices at pivotal moments. History isn't actually like EU4 or something. They had a small ownership ownership class, which benefitted greatly, and the rest of it was just dragged along in this inefficient, shitty mess. That's how commodity economies work. A small group of owners owns them and utilizes them, and they get wealthy while nothing else happens economically.

'The right to place demands on others' is what a positive right is, and it's only used for things where people need defending from having their rights violated. This is why childcare applies in this situation. *Somebody* has to take responsibility for this child, and that means you either give the child up for adoption or make the parents do it. And child support doesn't only apply to men. Women have to sacrifice their lives and finance by law if they choose to keep the child as well. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's not forget that the man in our situation could have avoided it early on. He has full rights to prevent a pregnancy before it happens. Of course he has fewer rights once it's occurring within someone else's body. newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that the woman's rights, that it would be barbaric to take from her, protect her decisions during this period isn't ideal, but it's a biological fact and you can't get around that without repercussions that are worse than the status quo. 
I tried to explain it further down, but it's not something I completely understand myself. I mean, socialisation comes into it - people tell us that we have to be manly and mock us if we're not. Men end up looking for ways to define and assert this manliness. Just look at how many movies there are about becoming a man (Mulan doesn't count).   newlinechar  newlinechar However, since manliness is mostly a social construct and the gender divide is reducing rapidly, it's hard to see what it is to be a man. As more and more women start doing the things that used to define men, men don't know how to be a man.   newlinechar  newlinechar Luckily, with age most of them develop a more internal idea of manhood and don't feel such a massive and constant need to prove their masculinity.

It's not as simple as that and you know it. A person can choose to do a great many things. A woman could choose to wait until she has the baby and then smother it and throw it out in the trash. Some cultures and beliefs systems include that as a valid choice. However to a woman who believes that abortion is murder, the abortion as a 'choice' it's no different than waiting until the baby is born and killing the infant at that time. It's not a valid choice for her. She could do it and then live the rest of her life believing she had murdered her own infant. Many would rather die themselves than do that.

Help me out here. Im going to graduate college in August 2015 and I know for sure I've always wanted to join the military. The bad thing is that I may end up with a not appealing GPA that might be between 2.7-2.9. Should I just not even try because I feel like my package won't be as strong as others?  Also is it easier to get a flying job ? I really don't know how to approach this in giving a shot at being an officer . But if I go enlisted I am perfectly find with that.

Yes I am guilty of taking recreational drugs, including RCs, but I don't think that the risk of a brand new drug being taken by a large quantity of people is worth the risk.  I haven't been shown any studies, and maybe I'm just being ignorant and they exist, comparing a drug like this vs alcohol.

Yeah 32bit operating systems do tend to run better on older PCs as it requires less RAM for each process and most old PCs have under the 4gb limitation of a 32bit OS anyway. I find Win7 32bit runs better on core 2 duo/quad than XP but for some reason XP is fantastic on the 3ghz pentium 4s.

Thank you, I'll check out those links. I guess I was under the misconception that knighthood was originally awarded for chivalric purposes such as bravery in battle and that kind of thing, which made it even more confusing for me to see how it's so often been given to celebrities lately. This thread has helped me understand the difference. However, I feel that maybe they're given out too easily lately? But I can see why people such as Sir Elton John are given a knighthood, for his lifelong, inspiring work in music. newlinechar  newlinechar Does it happen often that when a new monarch ascends to the throne that knighthoods are taken away if say, the new monarch does not agree with or like some people previously knighted? And even if not for that reason, can knighthoods be redacted? Such as if a knight is convicted of a serious crime such as treason or child abuse?

That's respectable. But you won't elect who you want to office with that attitude.

I definitely agree, you laid out all of the shitty things about clubbing in general. If you got a stable and you're making serious money clubbing once a week with your bitches is a must. Bitches need to blow off steam, they love getting dressed up and when you got a big booth in VIP with 4-5 of your bitches and a couple close friends it's a lot easier to pull in high end talent. newlinechar  newlinechar With that being said if you're just starting out and only have one bitch and on a tighter budget, then trying to beat out every other swinging dick in the place puts you at losing odds in the first place. I'd never really try and spit game at a club in any situation though. All I'd do at clubs is follow these simple guidelines... newlinechar  newlinechar 1. Post up and look for eye contact. newlinechar 2. Approach when the time is right. Approach the bitches that are looking at you, not the ones you're trying to force eye contact out of them. If you don't get any looks back on a regular basis it's you, not them. Hit the gym. Buy better clothes. Smile more.  newlinechar 3. Keep game very simple, be polite, introduce yourself. Lots of compliments. Ask them questions. Be sincerely interested. newlinechar 4. When the right song comes on, ask them to dance. Don't treat them like your sister but don't escalate things just yet.  newlinechar 5. Once you've danced for one or two songs unless she is giving you VERY strong signals, end it right now. Tell them you feel a really strong connection with them and you'd like to see them again. Get the number and then give them a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Text her right in front of her to give her your number back.  newlinechar 6. Your work here is done. Leave the club. Again, if she was acting like she wanted more, keep the text conversation going. If you go to another club let her know you left because you had to meet up with some friends. If she keeps texting you, you can head back to the same club where she was at and say you ditched your friends to meet back up with her. If she's not texting you back then don't text her again till the next day. newlinechar  newlinechar At the end of the day that's how it's suppose to work, but a prospect like this will only turn into a money maker I'd say about 1 in 10. You also have your off nights where you don't get any eye contact or when you do, your approach doesn't work. Or when your approach works, you tell them you feel a strong connection and then get a cock blocking best friend come up and steal her away. etc. The point being I don't mean to give anyone the impression that the above is a fool proof system for pulling in bitches every night. It's just what I would do and it worked enough of the time to keep on doing it. newlinechar  newlinechar

Sounds/looks like a possible gas valve or pressure switch issue. newlinechar  newlinechar If it only runs for about 2 mins AND the blower(big motor in the bottom compartment) kicks on at some stage during this then it's unlikely the high limit temp will be reached in this period even with a weak switch. newlinechar  newlinechar It's hard to tell but there's a definite and immediate clicking when the flames go out. To me that could be a weak coil in the valve. Although with stuttering flames it could be a pressure issue somewhere. newlinechar  newlinechar Check the rubber hose going to the round metal disc thing in the top left. Make sure it's clear. Does it click at all during the issue? On startup, the small inducer motor (at the top) will run and cause the pressure switch to 'click' once but that's all you should hear. newlinechar  newlinechar Also there may be an error code, if you look at the bottom panel is there a little porthole to look inside?

On days when I wash my scalp I get more tangles than usual. I'm not sure what your hair type is, but after I wash and rinse the conditioner out, I'll add another round of conditioner that I use to detangle, then leave in for a while to absorb into my hair. When I detangle I lean my head to one side so my hair hangs free and start gently detangling from the ends of my hair and work my way up. I gently coax apart the knots and glide my fingers between the strands a little at a time. Then I rinse all the hair out of my hands (yuck, right?) and lean my head to the other side and gently detangle again from the ends and working up. newlinechar  newlinechar I wasn't sure from your OP if you detangle from the ends up or from the roots down, but if you've been working your way down try starting from the ends instead.

If your win condition is at the bottom of your deck, you were gonna lose, REGARDLESS of whether fel reaver is there which is why I don't take that situation into account. newlinechar  newlinechar If your win condition is in your opening hand or before you play fel reaver you probably don't have the good opening any aggro deck NEEDS since your win condition is clogging up your hand. newlinechar  newlinechar If your win condition is right after you play turn 5-7 (since you would rather play sea giant in the late game) then your win condition is gone. newlinechar  newlinechar Tl dr: risking discarding your win condition isn't worth playing fel reaver as you are now hoping that it doesn't lie at the end of your deck OR right after fel reaver but rather in a small gap in between (a gap which is determined by your opponent

Bellingham to be exact, low wages, poor jobs and housing we can barely afford. 
In general I agree with the whole 'encourage the trades' thing, but it shouldn't be the only conclusion people draw. My office just hired 3 entry level positions, but they were certainly hoping for a mid-level hire in at least one case. If it's hard to find mid-level positions now, just imagine how it'll be if parents all tell their kids that things like the social sciences are worthless. Unfortunately, this will hurt the more cut off, 'brain drain' areas the most.

Ya, now that the interview is done, I absolutely don't agree with any praise of NVC.  I agree with asking the easy open-ended questions and letting the person just get it out.

The 'toughest' question even came with such a bullshit lead-in. newlinechar  newlinechar I get that there may have been preconditions for the interview, including no hard questions.  If that's the case, she could deny the interview instead of acting like she is reading questions pre-written by Jay's attorney or Urick.

This is exactly the problem mentioned.  newlinechar  newlinechar We all have to pretend that men *want* to share feelings, that we're all living a lie because we *can't* cry. That feminism is moving us in a healthy direction away from horrible masculinity. newlinechar  newlinechar I for one like being stoic. I'm not an emotional person. If someone tells me to man up I take a few steps back and consider how I'm handling a situation. If I'm crying about jamming my finger in a basketball game, I expect someone to tell me to shut up.

That's not a real reason, though.

Fuck the people down voting you. A grilled cheese sandwich has cheese as the focus and a melt has it melted as a garnish.

What I want to suggest is that we have to consider a person's capacity in order to properly consider their actions praiseworthy or blameworthy.  It would be hard to judge exactly what would count as 'using all of one's capacity to help others'--as you said, one might think that we would have to limit ourselves to fulfillment of our most basic needs in order to be worthy of praise for any charitable actions, which intuitively seems wrong.   newlinechar  newlinechar I think that it is important to recognize the difference in my capacity and  your capacity for assisting the impoverished (etc) compared to the capacity of someone like Gill Bates.  You correctly point out that there is almost certainly more that you and I could be doing.  But there is no doubt in anyone's mind that you and I do not have anywhere near the capacity to make a significant dent in, for example, world hunger.  And if we wanted to try anyway, we would likely have to limit ourselves to bare necessities.  People like Gill Bates, however, have that capacity, and they can do it while continuing to live a more comfortable life than nearly anyone else on the planet.  So I think that the issue has a lot to do with the excess wealth specifically.  But I would be willing to accept that people like you and I are blameworthy to some extent for not doing more--e.g., for not donating more to charity.  However, it would be to a lesser extent than someone like Gill Bates, since Gill Bates's capacity greatly surpasses ours.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: replied before seeing your edit  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit 2 (after having read your edit, and the NYT article): newlinechar  newlinechar I'm inclined to think that the article is right for the most part.  People ought to do more than they are doing.  At the end, they suggested that a person making $50000 has the same obligation as a person making $100000.  They didn't say anything about people making $1-million or $100-million, but presumably they would say that they all should be as close to $30000 as possible.  It seems like it would fit well with that thought, though, that people making $100-million deserve more blame for not limiting themselves to $30000 than people making $50000 do, just in virtue of how much they are missing the target by.  If Person_A makes $1-million each year, and Person_B makes $50000, even if Person_A donates $500000 each year, and Person_B donates $0, Person_A is still missing the target by significantly more than Person_B. newlinechar  newlinechar I have a question for you, though.  Why should charitable contributions not be something we consider when evaluating whether or not a person if worthy of praise or of blame?  In what sense are charitable contributions different from that beach scenario? 
Brilliant. Chief Keef would be proud.

Thanks. Sometimes I really let myself down by having a tantrum, and I'm always embarrassed by it. I still have them sometimes.  newlinechar  newlinechar For example at work the other day something wasn't going right for a client and he had to get on a flight in half an hour. I knew how to fix the problem with his laptop, that he needed for this trip, but I also knew there was a chance it could royally screw everything up. So it could take 20 minutes to fix if all goes right, or 3 hours to fix if it all went wrong. It all went wrong. So I'm running to my desk to go get a spare computer for him, and my stress is at a 10! the dude I was helping is laid back but you could tell he was pretty upset.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm running to my desk and the receptionist (an older very nice lady) wiggles her finger for me to follow her and I knew that in my state, I could easily blow, so I have to tighten my lips, keep quiet, and keep moving. She says 'NO FOLLOW ME!' and I yelled at her. 'NO I CAN'T, I'M BUSY!!'. I apologized later and told her I was in a very peculiar mood and should never happen. Its just that my dad just drowned a few months ago and I've been at the extremes mood-wise. newlinechar  newlinechar Another dude totally fucked up his order for new employees computers and when they didn't show up, I found that he had ordered only 1 and put in the comments 'I need three of these'. That doesn't work, you need to order 3 systems if you want three. I threw my hands up in the air and scoffed. I realized that was rather rude of me, and again apologized later in the day for my response.  newlinechar  newlinechar 3 years ago my little brother died unexpectedly and 2 weeks later I was with my spouse in the store and we got separated. As I wandered looking for him and his friends in wal-mart. I was getting more and more upset. I was getting so stressed for no good reason (just emotional) and punched a hole in a box of merchandise. Finally found him and started crying that I couldn't find him and I was angry.  newlinechar  newlinechar I know I have problems with my emotions coming out and constantly working on ways to deal with stress. Its a battle I'm winning every day. I really do try.

So a publisher (or publishers) can release those books again, a movie studio can make a movie from the books and a lot of people can cash in...except for him - the guy that actually wrote the book. newlinechar  newlinechar First of all, there is nothing stopping him from selling his old books just because the copyright has expired. People sell copies of works that are in the public domain every day.  I assume you're familiar with Project Gutenberg. I can freely download all those books, yet many of them are on my shelves today and I paid for them.  Let's say you're a huge fan of this fictional author and you want a copy of one of his old books. You are a fan and want to support him, so why don't you buy it from him directly? He can sell it off his website for next to nothing. He can sign them. He can update them and sell them under a new copyright. He isn't left out of the fun. He can even make movies based on his books (his involvement in a production is going to make it much more appealing to fans). At the same time, others can also sell his books or just throw them up on the internet and let other people read them. In the end, our fictional author gets new fans, more recognition, and more money (from sales of his books both old and new).    newlinechar  newlinechar How is this a bad thing?  newlinechar  newlinechar As for Mr. Martin, he absolutely should lose rights for those first books and if someone comes along and creates (for example) an animated series based on those first books more power to them, and all the better for fans of animation many of which will now run out and start reading the books (including the new ones still under copyright) gaining George even more fans who will gladly fork over their cash for his new works going forward.

This is a weird meme that has gotten traction in some political circles. No, there was some token assistance from the Chinese, but the Chinese were not huge fans of the Vietnamese. They were not on good terms, as shown by the fact that China invaded Vietnam shortly after the end of the War (in the ironically named Self-Defensive Counteroffensive). The soviets were not on much better terms, and between their lack of interest on the one hand and their inability to project geopolitical power outside their near-abroad on the other, they didn't do much. There were some advisors and such on the ground, and that was it.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not arguing for leftist agitation. I'm arguing that you should see things as they actually happened.

Reload usually reduces the cooldown of 1 spell by 1 hour. When energized, it affects the last two spells instead. newlinechar  newlinechar You need to reload twice to reset DR. However, after the first Reload, the last spell used isn't DR, since Reload counts too. That means your last spell is Reload, and your second-to-last is DR.   newlinechar If you use a non-energized Reload now, it will reset its own cooldown and then go on cooldown, effectively doing nothing. You need to energize it to reload itself (without effect) and DR.

Operating the massive Fomorian vessels is not an easy task. Fomorian Commanders are forced to undergo severe body modifications and are grafted to their ship, forced to fall with their sworn quarry should they fail in their mission. Due to the intense load on the body and the high levels of radiation incurred from operating a Fomorian, many vents and nutrient tubes sprout from the Commander to constantly recycle his interior waste and bodily fluids such as blood or augmentation byproducts. The Fomorian Commanders control most of the ships functions through their augments, but a console for basic commands such as firing, self destructing, or venting radiation exists below so that standard crewman can operate basic needs should the Commander die before the ship. The Commander lives in a large chamber with a clear view into space. The commander is suspended by a complex system of machinery that allows them to maneuver across the cavernous control room with ease. The control room contains a wide assortment of interfaces that are only accessible by the Commander and his elevated position, and the basic control panel sits atop a large pillar in the center of the chamber connected by a single walkway. Overrides, direct interfaces to various parts of the ship, and status terminals are just some of the exclusive controls for the Commander, and even if another was able to reach their positions on the walls of the huge chamber, only the Commander possess the necessary augments to interface with them. Thus, regular crewmen are forced to wait for rescue should the Commander die. More often than not, the command from on high is to activate the self destruct override on the base console to prevent Fomorian technology from falling into enemy hands.

It's also easier to gain the weight back right away. So no.
 I was doing some rather simple information that counters your placement of Rild, and thus counters your placement of Goku's strength. You comment that Rild is easily above the strongest form of Buu (and thus obviously Goku should be Vegetto level to explain how easily he beat him), yet you don't take into account Gohan. newlinechar  newlinechar  It's stated and shown to have all but totally neglected his training over the fifteen years between the Buu Saga and GT; stated repeatedly that he, Goten, and Trunks have been slacking off, to the point that Gohan is only now somewhat stronger in his base than Goten is as a Super Saiya-jin. And yet we see that Gohan is seemingly evenly matched with Rild (able to readily dodge Rild's attacks before Rild turned his arm into metal), and that Rild was easily dispatched by someone no stronger than Evil Buu in terms of power (Uubuu). newlinechar  newlinechar  So how exactly is Rild supposed to be far stronger than Gohan Buu when he was seemingly matched by someone that, at his utmost best, wasn't anywhere near Gohan Buu's strength (and who had been slacking for 15 years), and was destroyed effortlessly by someone far weaker than Gohan Buu?

We don't need to be throwing more to be more productive in the passing game. Bevell is VERY prone to do deep timing routes even though our OLine has severe protection issues which take forever to pan out and end up with Russell just scrambling around trying to do something. Some of his plays leave me scratching my head even nowadays. He is also prone to do 4/5 WR sets constantly in the redzone instead of pounding the rock. Our teams stats in the redzone show a team that can move down the field pretty easily but we stall in the redzone quite often.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now to give Bevell some leeway the receivers this year have been prone to drops. Willson and Kearse have dropped several this year at key moments. Those drops though don't change the fact that his plays are weird. I will be happy to see him gone and give a new OC a shot now.

The thing I like about it is that it's 'real', compared to most anime.  I do NOT mean real as in 'An accurate representation of reality', but as in 'Not including magical schoolgirls and people flying through the air and hovering in drama poses and transforming into vampire tentacle monsters and such'.  I don't watch much anime, mostly because 99% of what I see all looks like the latter category, to me.  Initial D, by contrast, gives me young street racers doing (semi)real things with real cars and no one's developed the ability to change into a ninja superheroine yet, so it's a world that I recognize and relate to.

I disagree. These people are, by design, immune to criticism. They just shout bull shit and don't listen to anyone. Plus, they are inherently unreasonable and unwilling to play by standard logic. This means words have no effect on them. Alternatively getting angry or, worse, physical/violent with them just validates in their eyes what they are saying and makes you worse than them.  newlinechar  newlinechar However, with a little girl most of this manipulation is no longer effective. What's he going to do, argue with her? Is he going to try to explain the 'word of the lawd' to her? Is he going to try to make her feel guilty about sins or whatever bull shit angle he would normally take? No, he can't do that. It wouldn't work and besides, doing any of this would move him from obnoxious pest to a scary threat to children if he starts lambasting a child.  newlinechar  newlinechar So what we have here is a menace who usually has society backed against the ropes as he takes advantage of his freedoms and a little girl using her societal advantages shouting him down. It's certainly not the most satisfying justice I've ever seen but it's rare that people like this can be neutralized in any sense. To that extent, it is still pretty sweet to watch even if only in small doses.

Holy books are written as allegory, you're not meant to take them literally. Take the message behind the stories, the stories themselves are just a vehicle for the message. The book was written down by mortal men, and you should not let a man tell you how to have a relationship with your God. That's between you and God, and should not be subject to the interpretation of some other human that you take as inherited wisdom. Do not let other men speak for your God. Commune with God in ways you feel are appropriate to your psychology.

Yes.  Any type of fantasies are 'normal,' including having none at all.  Or, it's possible she knows she doesn't want to act on her fantasies and prefers to keep it private.  For example, she might fantasize about being tied up and dominated, but be horrified at the idea of actually doing those things.  It's hard to say. newlinechar  newlinechar As for sex with you not being good, don't jump to that conclusion.  I have been the lower-libido in a relationship before (I prefer once to twice a week, but can easily go once a night.

Even if she only wants sex once a *year*--- is that sex wanted with *you*?  That's the important question. newlinechar  newlinechar As for getting her to be more sexual--- so much goes into this.  Of course, complaining, whining, coercion, ultimatums, shaming, etc Do Not Work (not saying you do or would do these things, but I always throw it out there).

It wasn't until the 1500s that we understood the uterus to be an upside-down pear-sized, pear-shaped organ with endometrial lining that's connected to fallopian tubes. newlinechar  newlinechar So no kidding, we knew that babies came from inside a woman. The word 'womb' came from the 8th century, but the word 'uterus' came from the 14th century, when our understanding of human biology was greater. newlinechar  newlinechar Is it that much of a stretch to say that the difference between a 'womb' vs a 'uterus' in earlier centuries is equivalent to the difference between 'the insides where babies are made' and 'an upside-down pear-sized, pear-shaped organ connected to fallopian tubes'?

3 replies, 0 relevance to what I mentioned. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Really? the number of people a government murders is completely irrelevant to your evaluation of it? In that case, you must love pinochet, massive economic growth and nothing bad happened that's worth mentioning! newlinechar  newlinechar It means the number of deaths doesn't define a form of government. Read it twice if you must. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; No, you couldn't. what part of 'us policy never starved tens of millions to death' are you having trouble with? newlinechar  newlinechar No, US foreign policy doesn't do that. Did I say that though? no I didn't.  However, US foreign policy does cause the deaths of thousands of people.  Over half a million people have died from the iraq war alone (may I remind you that this war was deemed unnecesary by many world leaders). Pinochet, the guy you're making fun of, killed 3k in his own country. I'm not from chile btw. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I never said it was. I said the consequences of american ideology are better because they result in fewer deaths, period. Not zero deaths, but fewer. newlinechar  newlinechar You don't seem to understand. I dont care about american, nor soviet ideology. But you're completely wrong in denouncing someone who speaks for commmunism as a regime apologist (jerk), then insisting that communism is defined by the actions of the soviets and chinese, all the while saying america is merely 'imperfect' for it's mistakes. That makes you an apologist of authoritarian regimes  and overall american foreign policy (which has resulted in several hundred thousand deaths, even if not famine related (doesn't make a death any less death anyways)). It also makes you a hypocrite for downplaying the horrible 'mistakes' (which were very  much purposeful) that the US has done and not accepting them as part of their identity. Those mistakes that  just keep on happening, up until this day.

I think often by the time a Civ has advanced to the point of being able to colonize and settle the empty continent, they have already established a number of cities they are comfortable with or otherwise fallen into a planned path for victory. newlinechar  newlinechar On island maps, they have no problem going out and settling because they don't have a chance to build more than one or two cities if they don't. newlinechar  newlinechar On CotNW, they only have one city and the rules forbid them from planting more in the Old World.  So naturally, they settle. For these reasons, I do not think there is actually a change in the AI though it is quite possible I am wrong.

I hope you don't mind but I already answered this, here is my response: newlinechar  newlinechar 'Here's are some examples of what I am talking about.

It was just, you know, the *principle.*  Also, getting annoyed when someone is late when it really doesn't inconvenience you at all, or borrowing a small amount of money you don't need back or something you don't miss.

I had a bank account with USAA that only existed to feed my USAA car insurance. When I got out of the military I updated my information on their site (bank/insurance website is combined) when I moved my car and needed to update my insurance info.  newlinechar  newlinechar All goes well till I get an automated phone call saying my insurance is going to get canceled if i don't respond. The bill was around $600 every six months and at the time I thought I was payed up till the end of the year but they changed some billing something and I found out that when the billing had come up, I was $30ish short. I didn't find this out as it happened, apparently many months ago the insurance side had been billing the bank side and coming up short, so the bank was deducting $60 twice a month from the account for telling the insurance side of USAA no. newlinechar  newlinechar This apparently was an OK arrangement for several months until the bank realized I didn't have any more money in the account to get another $60 fee out of me, only then did the insurance decide to call me. A call to insurance and they tell me that not only do I need to pay for six months like usual, I owed them money for the last 4 months my insurance paper has been technically valid and they haven't been getting paid. The bank said they can't do anything about the money lost in fees, as they notified me many times by sending a letter to an obviously overseas military address while my contact info on their fucking website is correct in every way. newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR I think the USAA assumed I had died and drained my accounts, couldn't get any help after as according to them it was all valid.

I understand the response but people have to realize that the Premier league always will be the main priority. City have made it through the group stages of the Champions league and are battling to retain the premier league title, and they need reinforcements. This is much more important missing some games at the beginning of a season. The CFG ownership made what is overall the best decision and it makes sense. Frank is doing well so simply extend his loan rather then signing another world class midfielder with money that could be used to buy a striker, seeing as we are restricted due to FFP.  newlinechar NYCFC fans have the right to be upset seeing as they probably don't support Manchester city anyways but if you think about it, you will probably be dominating MLS in a few seasons and you already have a world class striker. Why support a team over one player anyways? Its the city of New York that NYCFC represents and NYCFC is part of CFG and frankly that partnership is going to benefit in the long run.  newlinechar I am also pretty sure that City will send some EDS players as well as another designated player in the mean time so its not like everything is  completely a-wall because frank extended his loan.

Indeed. I could have gone into this more explicitly. The term has been used since before *any* contemporary religions existed, unless you count [Proto-Indo-European Neo-Pagan Reconstructionists](http://www.amazon.com/Deep-Ancestors-Practicing-Religion-Proto-Indo-Europeans/dp/0976568136). It was first spread widely as a place name suffix by the Sasanian Empire, a Zoroastrian state, and was deeply entrenched in the region before Islam came to the region. Even so, the Central Asian Muslim cultures of the -stans remained non-Arab, some -stans remained largely Christian or Zoroastrian or Tengrist for a long time, and -stan only became associated with Islam by the view of outsiders (mostly Russians and British), who were the ones responsible for **official** names including -stan. newlinechar

Alternately you could do a dry cure instead of a wet brine.  Takes a bit longer, but it would allow things like maple syrup to actually shine through instead of just being hopelessly diluted. newlinechar  newlinechar A tablespoon or so of kosher salt per pound of meat, plus a teaspoon (per pound) of a mix of whatever spices you think will go good.  In this case I'd treat the maple syrup as an extra, and add it in addition to that tsp/lb of spices.  Maybe a tsp/lb of it as well, but I'm not sure - I'd probably just wing it, going for a paste consistency.  Then rub the whole mess on your loin, wrap it in plastic and put it in the fridge - flip it once per day, until it's given off a bunch of water and turned your cure into a syrup (probably 2-3 days?) newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, if this were *me*, I'd introduce some pink salt into that mix, and go for a 6-7 day cure time, and make it into a proper Canadian bacon.

a.k.a. a flour sack, a construct of woven burlap, tubular in shape, with a flat sewn lower double seam. Once filled with desired material, a tear away flat seam is used to secure said material inside. Burlap, also called Hessian, is a rough and durable fabric made from plant fibers, usually jute or sisal. newlinechar  newlinechar Once, empty, they make good sleds. The rough fibers trap snow and ice which makes for low friction while giving good grip for the rider. Ditto for hard surfaces. A rough solid weave makes for low area of contact.

I think your nose is just fine. Yeah, it's bigger than average, but so is mine and my wife's (in fact, my wife is attracted to people with big noses, but anyway....). There are a lot of ethnicities known for bigger noses, including Arabs, Persians and Italians (I have many friends from those ethnicities). I don't know, to each his/her own, I guess, but I think reshaping it through cosmetic surgery would not be very high on a list for what you can 'do better,' as you ask, since it's not disproportionate at all to your face. It has it's own charm. We all need quirks to set us apart from the crowd. :)

I'll give it a shot! So they both start with 501 points and the aim is to get to 0. Incase you don't know the small outer coloured band means the number he lands on is doubled and the small inner band means it is tripled. For the first six darts he tries to score as many points in as few darts as possible, by aiming for the treble 20 (the most points available in one dart). Then with the final three darts he finishes off the remaining points (treble 20, treble 19 and double 12) therefore going from 501 points to 0 in the lowest possible number of darts. Hope this makes sense.

No, I absolutely agree that informed consent to suicide is a real thing that ought to be respected. But in general, queer suicides are produced by a vicious culture that systematically denies queers their identities or right to exist. If the culture shifted, many of the queers who are pushed to suicide would not make that choice. And to ignore that nuanced difference is to excuse hetero-patriarchy and its violent ramifications.

If I got seriously stuck, I would. The rope is more for situations where, say, I try to get through some snow or mud that is just a little too deep. newlinechar  newlinechar I've actually considered the Odyssey, but I've since moved away from it, and living in a van in general. The idea is great, but it doesn't seem like the ideal solution, since, whether I'm commuting around town or taking a 1000 mile road trip, I have to carry my home with me, burning all that extra gas in the process. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, while I would have no problem living out of a minivan while I'm travelling, I don't think I could do it while I'm working. Working a job, you are under a lot more stress, so I'd want a few more comforts (such as being able to stand up inside) that I couldn't swing with an Odyssey.

Lets say they stockpile and want 100 crates on each character to last them 3 weeks. Thats going to take them 50 beasts. Since double trapping is OP, and they have 3 people they can knock out 50 beasts in under a hour. Do that on 6-7 characters each over the course of a week.

Supposedly there's a [difference](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/wicked-deeds/201401/how-tell-sociopath-psychopath) between psychopath and sociopath, with the psychopath not feeling much emotion from birth and the sociopath generally experiencing a traumatic event which triggers psychotic break and the disassociative disorder.

Once the vehicle is immobilized, it becomes the property of the police department in the sense that the driver is not permitted to move it without paying their outstanding fines or, for unusual cases, receiving permission from the commander on duty. So it wouldn't be their property, it would be ours. Regardless, it's theft to take the device with them once they remove it. I suppose that leaves them with either taking the device with them (theft) or destroying it and leaving it behind (destruction of property), so either way they're left with charges of some sort.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would be curious, however, to see a case where someone manages to pick the lock and leave the device.

I think a better picture is just that the details of individual cases are mattering less and less.  People, especially communities of color, and *especially* working-class black communities, have been pissed for a looooong time about police.  With the mass protests and riots around Ferguson and subsequent acts of police violence creating a kind of rupture in the normal functioning of society, people's will for nuanced, case-by-case analysis fades away in favor of continuing the movement.  This, combined with the historic and growing lack of trust between cops and the community, make people even more inclined to not really care about the details of the case ('cops are just gonna lie about it anyway', etc).   newlinechar  newlinechar Note that I'm not placing any moral judgement on anybody here; this probably just the way things are going to go.  There is too much momentum in terms of the historical and structural context of *actually* unwarranted police violence for nuance to enter into the relatively spontaneous nature of the current waves of protests.

Well you mentioned having all the corrupted mods - ODA has nothing to do with corrupted mods, which is primarly done on ODE. newlinechar  newlinechar Are you making sure the game the system appropriately? You don't want to bring a full load out - just one strong weapon and a slow nova. The more level 30 weapons you bring, the higher level Lephantis becomes. You also obviously don't want to join pug groups because of how boss scaling functions. newlinechar  newlinechar And yes, its slower than Alad V, no one is saying its faster. The thing is though, Neurodes have a number of ways to get them. You want a few guaranteed ones, go run Lephantis. But you can slowly build your stockpile by doing other things as well. Go run ODS, try to get a nova part. Do an ODD, get a boltor reciever to sell. The reason people complain much less about neurodes is that you can collect Neurodes while completing other objectives in the game. While running Alad V is fairly painless and quick, the biggest frustration is that you have to go out of your way to do it. You don't simply get them by doing other objectives in the game, farming a neural sensor is a specific objective you have to slot time in for. But lets say you want T3 keys, the best place is on earth, which also drops neurodes. It drops from 2 missions that drop prime parts. There are multiple methods to get neurodes, so at least people feel like they have options, while with Neural Sensors all you have is alad V over and over and over and over again.

There's a very valid reason USB mass storage is no longer supported. In order to support that, phones had to split there internal storage in order to have a fat32 partition a computer could mount. This split was determined by the manufacturer, meaning you could easily have run our of room for apps but have plenty for other storage uses, or vice versa. By using MTP, newer versions of Android allow the internal storage to be used by the phone for whatever you need, and still let the storage be read by a computer. In my opinion this is a much better option. As for everything else you mentioned, I agree.

Interesting then, that the Soviets never paid them for it. No, this was a stupid move aimed at 'improving relations with the Soviets' newlinechar  newlinechar Keen to thaw Anglo-Soviet relations, British Prime Minister Clement Attlee invited Soviet scientists and engineers to the Rolls-Royce jet facility to learn how the superior British engines were made. Attlee further offered to license production to the USSR—after exacting a solemn promise that the engines would be utilized only for non-military purposes. The offer stunned the Americans, who protested loudly. And the Soviets? Russian aviation historian and Ukrainian native Ilya Grinberg says, “Stalin himself couldn’t believe it. He said, ‘Who in their right mind would sell anything like this to us?’ ” Grinberg, a professor of technology at the State University of New York at Buffalo, points out that the presence in the delegation of Artem Mikoyan himself—the “Mi” in MiG—should have been a tip-off to what in fact ensued: The Rolls-Royce samples shipped to the USSR in 1946 were promptly installed into MiG-15 prototypes and successfully flight-tested. By the time the fighter was ready for mass production, the Soviets had reverse-engineered the Nene; their copy was designated the Klimov RD-45. When the British objected to the violation of their licensing agreement, says Grinberg, “the Russians just told them ‘Look, we incorporated a few changes. Now it qualifies as our own original design.’ ” newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Read more: http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/the-jet-that-shocked-the-west-180947758/#CmObSEBQ0v0cDJUP.99 newlinechar Save 47% when you subscribe to Air &amp; Space magazine http://bit.ly/NaSX4X newlinechar Follow us: @AirSpaceMag on Twitter newlinechar  newlinechar From the very beginning the design was a sequence of compromises.

Hello all, I'm prospectre. I'm 25, and have been playing games for 22 years. I'm from California and unfortunately opted into the working stiff role far too early.

Thing is, you can say the exact opposite for abortion. If women don't want kids so badly but want to sleep with the whole town, they should get their tubes tied by your logic.

Why should men be forced to waive their reproductive rights for life just to not have to deal with children? They shouldn't is the answer to that question.

You are kinda of acting offensive and claiming i'm just making this post to be a an upvote whore, which i find a little disgusting.

A little late with this first post, but I'm a first-timer on this show.  Looks interesting.  Prior to this, the only depiction of rural Japan I've seen in anime was _Non Non Biyori_.  Here we have hardcore farming/ranching.  It's a bit nostalgic, in a way, because I grew up in a heavily agricultural region (California, though, and I was never into the whole ag scene, heh). newlinechar  newlinechar [00:45](http://i.imgur.com/r359jaJ.jpg) — Haha, yep, ag regions *stink*, dude.  If it ain't dairy farm cow shit, it's defoliating agents or field burns or… newlinechar  newlinechar [03:38](http://i.imgur.com/xRqpJHg.jpg) — It's funny how seldom you see nut-shot jokes in anime. newlinechar  newlinechar [04:20](http://i.imgur.com/PlB6HBG.jpg) — Holy shit, is she riding a *Clydesdale?*  Overkill, honey! newlinechar  newlinechar [05:10](http://i.imgur.com/XvAj7Cj.jpg) — Wait, junior high?

Oh well. newlinechar  newlinechar [05:30](http://i.imgur.com/JwNa1F4.jpg) — Ok, so we have a Fat Chick character.  Also super unusual for anime. newlinechar  newlinechar [05:47](http://i.imgur.com/knSQBuJ.jpg) — Cheeeese!  She's my hero already.  (Don't the Japanese think of cheese as a weird, disgusting food?) newlinechar  newlinechar [08:37](http://i.imgur.com/XAAoIbd.jpg) — Yeah, farm life ain't for the squeamish.  You won't find me doing it either. newlinechar  newlinechar [09:00](http://i.imgur.com/kHGQNWj.jpg) — This is something few people realize who have not lived in ag regions.  You think cow shit stinks?  Dairy farms reek?  Sure, they do.  But you haven't smelled *anything* till you've smelled a chicken ranch.  Holy mother of god.  They're tasty, but those little fuckers excrete the essence of Satan or something. newlinechar  newlinechar [10:01](http://i.imgur.com/60j2zHc.png) — Cloaca.

If you think the answer to queer suicide is to call bullies murderers then I feel that your energy could be better directed.  That's really all I want to say.

Without getting into a huge thing, that would be true if the shot had arc and a traditional trajectory. But it doesn't. You mentioned 'chance in form'. This isn't chance in form, this is chance in arc. A basketball has less likelihood of going through the hoop with a flatter and flatter shot. With less room for error, there is more of a chance that something other than the ball going through the hoop will happen. No matter if Kobe was birthed to shoot a shot as flat as Tim Duncan's or Joakim noah's, his shot WILL be more sporadic as far as consistency goes whether or not he has perfected his form or not.

I do know what you mean. There isn't a term. In all truth, despite the tempting possibility of examining the economic structure and patriarchy separately, you can't. Instead, it's worthwhile and actually rhetorically essential to incorporate a gendered analysis of capital into your understanding. I'd read Silvia Federici and also I'd google 'intersectional feminism'. Thanks for seeming willing to learn and re-examine your politics.

I think you need to calm down. I can hear you telling through my phone. I disagree with everything you've said and it's contrary to what I've been taught in University, it's what I minor in. newlinechar  newlinechar Like I've said before, racism can be small interactions or they can be large interactions like shooting someone in the head like you mentioned (which is a very good example btw). newlinechar  newlinechar I'm going to reiterate that I have clearly been saying that there is not systemic racism against white people. I know you hate that I repeated that but the truth is, there are levels of racism just like all kinds of prejudice and discrimination. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm a gay white-passing male. I think it's homophobic when people get offended by someone else asking them if they're gay when they're actually straight. Is it oppressive? Not really, but it hurts and affects me as an individual. newlinechar  newlinechar So it is when a white person is called a name like 'whitey.' It may affect individuals, and greatly, but it isn't a shared systemic problem that white people face. Meanwhile, every other race is systemically affected by things by the color of their skin whether it's buying a house, getting a job, going shopping, or walking down the street. newlinechar  newlinechar Is one worse than the other? I don't think that's possible to say. They're all bad and mean at the very least and we should work against all types of prejudice. However, right now in the world I am focused on certain things that are more prevalent. I'm not concerned about homophobia, I'm concerned about racism towards people of color because right now those are the people being highly affected. newlinechar  newlinechar Hopefully that clarifies what I'm trying to say. Please don't get angry, it's silly to be upset on the Internet.

Sorry, I read main as in main account. newlinechar  newlinechar  But even so, doesnt that just prove my point? I can guarantee you, 100% that you can support better than 99% of the platinum supports. But playing in diamond will get you owned, because you are not as good. And if you have a 75% winrate, you should be able to keep that up to diamond 1 right? Well, guess what, Pobleter got hyped when  going 71% into challanger, so how come you can't even stay at the Dia 1 if you got such an awesome winrate? Travelling and having a bad ping  is a handicap, yes. But not big enough to throw you around like that. The problem is in your play, not anything else.  newlinechar  newlinechar D1 is now like mid d1 before. Even if it's easier to jump around in divisions, would you say any random diamond 5 jungler is better, or at the same skill level as, let's say Trick2g? Or any other D1 jungle mains. They simply put are not, and I am a toplane main myself, I have no problem outplaying any jungle main from d5.

The goal in each 'leg' of darts is to score 501 points exactly (and you must finish with a double or the bull).  The two players take turns to throw 3 shots each, and the winner is the person who gets there first (giving an advantage to the player who throws first, and thus this is rotated, similar to server advantage in tennis). newlinechar  newlinechar This video is of a '9 dart finish'. This is famed because 9 darts is the absolute minimum that you can score 501 with.  There are a few different ways to get there, but typically this means throwing 180 with your first 3 darts (3 treble 20s), 180 with your second 3 darts, and then 141 as I described above. newlinechar  newlinechar Does that answer your question, or have I misunderstood you?

Only issue I have with your post is your thoughts on her range. Spell and basic attack ranges are measured differently for some strange reason. Spells are measured from the centre of the caster to the centre of the target, while basic attacks are measured from the edge of the attacker to the edge of the victim. This means that basic attacks are about 100 units longer than spells. Cass' range is closer to Ashe's, but not longer than Cait's. The rest is pretty spot-on.

I also had an awful experience with them.  They sent me to collections but I ended up fighting it and demanding that they take me to court.  I also work for a lawyer so I presented a very strong case from the beginning. They backed down and pulled the collection file. newlinechar  newlinechar Long story short, I signed a lease which included an addendum to the lease giving me my 13th month free upon signing a 12 month lease.  The problem apparently was that I ended up staying for 4 years, I should add that the company changed 'hands' multiple times but was always associated with Sterling Karamar.  After enduring years of building neglect, holes in ceilings, supers who didn't do their job and constant water shut-offs, I gave proper notice of 60 days.  In my last month they started harassing me about not paying last months rent, which I signed to be waived in the addendum and had paid every month since then. So watch out if you signed any lease signing 'bonus'.   
Sadly as much as I would love to believe in one unit, I think the more smash games/mods come out, the less its gonna be a thing. All fighting games suffer from this, for example look at the hatred towards SFxTekken. Even if a certain group of people love it (and its actually a very deep game which just deserved a patch) it was still shunned away by the community. Or, in the case of smash, look at how the docummentary makes brawl look like.

using any disorder as a joke or insult is pretty childish regardlelss.

I am trying to see if my pre-order went through. So far when I type my info into the Guest/In-Store orders, it says no orders are found. I ordered it to be shipped to my house instead of picked up, though. newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR, I want to know if they can use my order number (which they gave me after I finished my pre-order) to find out if it was processed correctly. I don't want my money to go to waste if they're not going to send the game.
Cleaning a gas block and piston head isn't much different if you're a civilian and you have a lot of time (relatively) between comparatively small volumes of fire, but for a military purpose, where more rounds are fired with longer times between less-thorough cleanings, piston systems are better because the fouling is at least in a place where it will affect the cycling of the rifle less. newlinechar  newlinechar I understand piston ARs don't buffer the recoil as well as a DI AR, because of the larger, heavier piston, though. But then you consider that an AR doesn't have much recoil to start with, and I suppose sacrificing some of that to help prevent jams is a good idea. I also think that when the Army was looking to replace the M4 back in 2004, the fact that *all* of the options presented to them (SCAR, HK416, XM8, etc.) were piston systems, and not DI, kind of speaks for itself on the faith gun manufacturers, at least, have in DI systems.
I know it's surprising but I personally believe delayed gratification is, in fact, a good thing.

He's specifically saying that it's impossible for an object to accelerate *to* c, if I'm understanding right. 
Although in those cases, it's really a regular CPU with an iGPU which has been fused out, right?  For example, if the iGPU is faulty but the CPU core is perfectly fine, they'd just disable the iGPU at the hardware level and ship it as a -P model.  They still make a fair amount of money, and people who don't need an iGPU for anything get a slight discount. newlinechar  newlinechar Either way, it's not like a different design where they take out the iGPU and replace it with 'more' CPU (maybe they could put more cache in there?).
You can do either, so who cares?

i got bored with vanilla versus like 30 hours into it. luckily i eventually ended up in a dlr server right when i was about to move onto another game but dlr was a magical place where the action was much more intense and i could see the skill ceiling was set so much higher than vanilla. Some people can play the same 20 death charge lines and the same 15 smoker pulls every campaign. Not me. I got bored real fast, I needed more depth and variety and strategy. By the second or third playthrough of each campaign i knew exactly what was going to happen at each and every turn from each and every infected opponent (baring the noobs that didn't know yet, but its okay every seemed to scream at them for missing their charge or not smoking from the right place ) and i knew what was required of me at each and every corner as an infected, because that is the only strategy you have, you have to hit that death charge line and you have to smoke from exactly right here and no where else, you have to jockey and run them through this exact window, you have jump from right here and spawn midair right here to boom them. bleh. kill me now. it got so boring, so very fast to me. I get bored with games real quick and move on to the next one, but dlr has kept me coming back again and again because of the challenge and the intensity of every moment and the wonderful, hilarious community of regulars on the servers newlinechar  newlinechar Also there are some things i could never go back to on a vanilla server.  like being incapped and not being able to take pills/shots to stand up or pull yourself up the ledge, or press ctrl and drop down off the ledge. or not being able to jump with the jockey when riding people or letting go of a victim as an infected (hunter body hops are so fun!) or not having spit that slows down the survivors a little bit or not having fast moving (when holding crouch) boomers or being given a weapons kit and choosing the survivor classes (i guess dlr mod people used the classes that were already in the game that valve took out right before the release) it's seriously like playing L4D2.5 or i suppose you could consider Dead Land Rape as the never coming out l4d3. It adds so much to the game that i feel like vanilla is a demo version of l4d2. it's so simple and constricting and boring.  newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR Vanilla Versus is like banging sumo-uggos then you start banging nothing but supermodels (!dlr) then you're suddenly being offered another sumo-uggo. yeah... not appetizing at all, now i know some people enjoy their sumo-uggos and i'm not gonna stop ya if that's what you truly want but if you wanna bang some supermodels i can introduce you to some  lol newlinechar http://steamcommunity.com/groups/DLRGaming newlinechar  newlinechar lol but seriously, the offer goes to you as well, if you want to learn how to play L4D2.5:!dlr I'll show you in about 2 or 3 minutes how glorious Valhalla can be newlinechar

I would say because it's very difficult to measure the impact of a charitable donation, it's also harder to say donating or not donating is worthy of either praise or blame. A child drowning on a beach is an immediate problem, and saving them is an immediate conclusion that cleanly solves the issue. Obviously, donations aren't like that. They may feed a child for a day, or help build a new water filter, but in what way is that measured? How successful will it be? Is it successful or helpful at all? Can it even be potentially harmful? How will those results be translated into a medium other people can understand, and if they are translated will they be impressive?  newlinechar  newlinechar The second difference has to do with circumstances. Although it may seem otherwise, a child drowning is not in the same type of peril as an Africn child starving, for example. The starving child's problems were brought around as a result of their surroundings and environment, both political and cultural. Starving in this sense is not a random act, like drowning, but a part of daily life. It's similar to the Joker's metaphor about no one losing sleep if thousands of soldiers are killed in battle, but if a terrorist kills an old woman on the street it's a national crisis.  newlinechar  newlinechar I would also disagree with you that anyone, including Bill Gates, is 'blameworthy' for not donating to charity. I would also say that someone on the beach who didn't help the children even if they had the capacity to is not in any way at fault or at blame for their drowning. Society might paint it that way, but the best way to look at the concept of blame is this: If the person in question didn't exist (say Bill Gates for example, or the swimmer) would the problem still occur exactly the same? If yes, that individual is in no way to blame or at fault. newlinechar  newlinechar Therefore the only thing someone can get from a donation is credit, no matter how much they give, regardless of numbers or percentages.  newlinechar

Pretty standard OSDM drumming, the only thing that stood out to me about him is that he prides himself on being able to play 'hard' and saying that most other players  rely too heavily on triggers to help with their intensity and speed. At the beginning of the video, it seems as if he doesn't have the stamina to match the correct tempo changes with his hands; Although, it is notable that his double bass is quite fast and clean. He's just not a player that fancies ornate playing like Bercier, Mounier, Blomberg, or Longstreth. I hate to sound critical, because the man does have great talent, but those straight-forward beats and grooves are antiquated, to a certain point it's like he is beating a long dead dog.

I understand how highly you're valuing a level 3 gank, but there are a few flaws to your theory here: newlinechar  newlinechar *  if you're a jungler with 14/2/14 masteries against a jungler with 21/9 masteries and you both meet in the jungle at the same level, the jungler with 21/9 masteries is going to shit on you in a duel, giving the 21/9 jungler the pressure/map advantage. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar *  If you don't manage to get a successful level 3 gank in early on, then you're going to eventually get outscaled by the 21/9 jungler. If you do, then that's good, but then you're going to have to keep applying the pressure like that or hope that your team knows how to keep their advantages if you want to be able to beat the opposing jungler with 21/9, and in SoloQ, it's too risky to be relying on your teammates like that. newlinechar  newlinechar The only jungler that I would see your masteries being good on is someone like Udyr. newlinechar  newlinechar

I'm sorry you received that comment. While there are female MRAs who try to get the approval of the 'boys' club,' I think your intentions were misunderstood.

I think it's important to affirm to folks that we do care about men, and acknowledging privilege does not dismiss the very real struggles men face (mostly due to the patriarchy). However, any engaging with MRAs is emotionally, mentally, and spiritually draining in my experience. It's not worth it. They won't change their minds unless they want to. It's scary and sad.

It was only for a specific category of porn videos though and it was only on a specific day or two. I checked how much a tree planting charity would charge to plat the amount of trees that PornHub managed to donate and it worked out to something pretty small, like a few thousand dollars which is nothing to them. newlinechar  newlinechar So a few thousand dollars got PornHub mentioned on 100s of sites in a positive way, tens of millions must have heard about it. So the amount of good publicity they got for every $ the campaign cost them must be crazy high, like one of the best. newlinechar  newlinechar If this thread was a marketing ploy it wouldn't even come close because only people of this single sub would see it and everybody here would already use Steam and like Steam anyway.

I'm not sure who was most at fault for the Harvin fiasco, but the fact is he only averaged 7 yards per catch when he was here. It really did seem like we were over using the screen game and it wasn't doing particularly well. Wilson's Y/A was barely 7 in the 5 games that Harvin was here. People complained that every time Harvin touched the ball it was a pass that didn't cross the LOS. While not completely accurate, it certainly seemed that way at times. newlinechar  newlinechar Harvin's TD against the Chargers was on a run where he actually stepped out of bounds, FWIW, not a bubble screen. Harvin never had a receiving touchdown as a Seahawk. As for the plays against Washington I'm not sure using plays that were called back due to penalties really counts. I'm all about quick passes and screens, especially against the blitz. I for one love the play were everyone goes right and RW throws across the field to his left to hit a RB (usually Marshawn) who leaked out of the backfield. My only fear is that Bevell will call it at the wrong time, against the wrong defensive coordinator, and it results in a pick 6. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I'm sure you know it's best to ignore what people say in game threads, although it's hard for me at times, too. People complain about the game threads on /r/nfl but I think the vibe is just as bad when we are playing poorly over on /r/Seahawks. newlinechar  newlinechar My main concern about our offense/coordinator is our ability to move the ball while trailing late in the game. While we were able to do it in our loss against the Rams, we struggled in our other 3 losses. Bevell even called a jet sweep on our own 10 yard line (that went for a 5 yard loss) with a few minutes left and we were losing. That's the sort of thing that makes people call for DB's head.

That's because the five year timeline was a marketing strategy to draw in new readers who would otherwise be intimidated by decades of canon history. Now that the New 52 is no longer 'new', editorial shackles have been loosened, and writers are going back and retconning portions of that five year history as they see fit. It's really not that different from writers in 2009 retconning details that happened a decade before.

What the Jews have done to piss off people in history newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Be different newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Continue to be different newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that they (or we, since I'm Jewish) have been persecuted across the globe for the better part of forever speaks more to intolerance for religious and ethnic diversity than some evil plot by the money grubbing Jews.  newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, Hitler's complaint about the Jews involved them being parasites in Germany and thus keeping down the ethnically superior Aryan race (which was a horrible misinterpretation of anthropology itself). This mostly arose from the Jewish influence on Weimar Germany, which had become a center for liberalism in the arts since the fall of the German Empire. The only thing the Jews did wrong was paint and write novels that were risqué and not traditionally German in the way Hitler saw Germanic culture. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, Hitler going a 'little overkill.' You do realize that he systematically murdered 11 million people for no reason other than pure unadulterated racism, right? There is a big gap between accepting Jews and forcing them into ghettos like most of Europe had done. There is a canyon or two between ghettos and genocide. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I love this.

The fits of rage, job instability and moving frequently were the traits I saw primarily through sociopathy.

In the current US political climate, it is not possible to champion a purely socialist platform and be elected to office, let alone the presidency. Even Bernie's beliefs, should he decide to run for President, would be spun by FOX using graphics from the Red Scare from dawn till dusk.  newlinechar  newlinechar The only way you create such a shift in opinions towards socialism is through a cultural paradigm shift over a number of years. The abolishing of slavery did very little to shift public opinion of blacks, but as time went on, the culture came to view blacks as humans too, and recognised the evils of slavery. The same thing happened with gun control in Australia: regulations were put into place despite strong opposition, and gradual acceptance of those regulations created a climate where it would now be politically lethal to run against it. We changed how the system worked, and people gradually learned to accept it. newlinechar  newlinechar Same thing here. Whether you agree with Bernie wholeheartedly or don't think he goes far enough, the fact remains that he is the best option for any socialist to support, because he is the only one capable of bringing that cultural paradigm shift that would cause people to warm to socialism. Once people get a taste of a universal healthcare system, of a $15 minimum wage, and of a properly functioning education system, they *will* come to see socialism without hostility. It wouldn't be unreasonable then, to make that culture that Bernie could help create, a stepping stone to an even further leftist government.

&gt;I’ve never really liked children. Even when I was one of them, they often annoyed me. I was always so quiet, laid back, and independent. Most children are none of these things.

What about a trait with type parameters though, like `Add`? From a quick test it seems like it's allowed as long as one of the parameter types is defined in your crate, which seems sensible to me. newlinechar  newlinechar However, something odd came up during my test. If I have newlinechar  newlinechar     #[deriving(Copy)] newlinechar     pub struct Unit; newlinechar  newlinechar     impl Add&lt;i32, i32&gt; for Unit { newlinechar         fn add(self, rhs: i32) -&gt; i32 { newlinechar             rhs + 1 newlinechar         } newlinechar     } newlinechar  newlinechar     impl Add&lt;Unit, i32&gt; for i32 { newlinechar         fn add(self, _rhs: Unit) -&gt; i32 { newlinechar            self + 1 newlinechar         } newlinechar     } newlinechar  newlinechar Then `Unit + 5` works fine (as expected), `5.add(Unit)` works fine, but `5 + Unit` fails with `error: mismatched types: expected '_', found 'Unit' (expected integral variable, found struct Unit)`. This behaviour seems odd to me - I thought `+` was desugared to `.add(...)`, so I'm not sure why this fails.

As a huge Silva fan, Weidman was the first person since Vitor that genuinely scared me. So many people were writing him off as an unproven chump, thinking Anderson would toy with him like he did everyone else, but something was different about Weidman. He had a hunger and a tenacity we hadn't seen before. And then the big names started coming out of the woodwork, picking him to win. Then I got really nervous. This guy's going against Anderson Silva and he's not even scared? He's actually confident he's going to beat him! Is this guy crazy? No, he's just that good. newlinechar  newlinechar I have that exact same feeling about DC, except this time I know what that feeling is. The static in the air surrounding this fight is palpable, and this time I can see clearly what it means. A storm is brewing. I'm calling it now, DC is gonna get in Jones' face and completely fuck up his world. He's not going to get discouraged and stand at rage getting picked apart like everybody before him. He's gonna get right in his grille and make a war out of it. And Jones is gonna break, because deep down, he's a bully. He doesn't know how to handle someone who just won't go away quietly, and we saw that against Gus. Jones' saving grace was that Gus just didn't have enough gas left in the tank to pour it on in r4 and r5, and Jones had fought enough main events that he did. But Cormier is different. He's been training to defeat bullies his entire life. He's got more than enough to go hard for five rounds, and that's exactly what he's gonna do. Get inside that stork reach, dump Jon on his head, and pound on him for 5 rounds. It's gonna be biblical.

It's not really the difficulty of acquiring these weapons, it's more about the time frame within which you can acquire them. All the weapons in the exceptional category are seasonal or promotional, so they are only available during a select time period. Some examples include the NS-15M AE, the snow gun, the Heartstring, etc. The directive weapons are available all the time. I do agree, however, that there should be a directive category specifically for the directive weapons. It could reward a title, decal, camo, ornament, certs, anything that could display that you have completed auraxiums on all the directive weapons.

Thank you for reading my comments. I didn't mention that I am on disability benefits and Medicaid. The day that Obama Care went into affect, my long time psychiatrist called me to let me know that they were no longer taking Medicaid. I freaked out because they were giving me benzodiazepines for the facial problems and I was able to drive. So I set out to find a new shrink. I got online to the provider dir and called every number on the list. Not one was taking Medicaid anymore. So I suffered and sometimes would have to go without food and other supplies for the house because I don't know anyone where I live. Finally, out of desperation I went in to see my PCP, we have a good relationship and he was my uncle's PCP also. So I told him everything and he said that he would give me 1mg ativan 2x day and a muscle relaxer. I went back the next month and he said that he could treat me for the pain and also stay on the ativan but I have to sign a pain contract. I am not sure what to do because I am extremely uncomfortable with that, even though I would easily pass. But he said that I would have a file with the DEA and they have audits. I have a problem with that. Well a friend from high school came over and gave me a small bag of weed even though I don't smoke it, he said just keep it incase you need it. Twice last month I considered smoking some because my pain was off the charts. Both times I decided not to. If I do that and my PCP says he can't give me any meds until I drug test I am going to be in deep water. So, I don't know what to do.

This would either push Domain to the point of broken, or not do nearly enough to strengthen it. newlinechar  newlinechar The way I understand Domain's cost is that it's overcosted at domain = 0-2, on curve at 3, and better at 4 and 5. This means that without searches or other land shenanigans, you're playing with strictly worse cards until turn three where you start to break even. newlinechar  newlinechar There are two ways you can play this. In one, it's not that game-breaking. In the other, it's horrifying. newlinechar Here's the conventional way, the lands-in-play method: newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously if you're planning to do this you're going to want to add some land-playing cards (namely [[Cultivate]] and [[Harrow]]). Using these can get you to 4 fairly consistently by turn 3. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, what would adding the 6th basic land do? newlinechar  newlinechar For a longer game, it gives you amazing cards. [[Tribal Flames]] will do 6 damage for 2 mana. [[Draco]] costs 4. newlinechar  newlinechar [[Gaea's Might]] gives a creature +6/+6 until end of turn for the cost of a [[Giant's Growth]]. newlinechar  newlinechar The question, though, is can you last that long? newlinechar  newlinechar To build a deck like this, you'd probably make a deck that's only basic land so that you don't risk playing a land that's dead to Domain. This means that your fixing is limited to fetch lands and green ramp cards. Not counting the ramp cards, your domain will increase by one each turn, IF you play a land you don't already have in play. With 5 basic lands you've got less than a 50% chance that it will increase on turn three. With 6, it gets a bit better, but still not fast enough without ramp. newlinechar  newlinechar So let's take a look at some ramp, then: newlinechar  newlinechar [[Sakura Tribe Elder]] newlinechar  newlinechar [[Cultivate]] and it's almost functional reprint, [[Kodama's Reach]] newlinechar  newlinechar [[Harrow]] (good at getting rid of duplicates!) newlinechar  newlinechar These are all great ways of ensuring 5 land types on turn 4, which is the sort of thing we're looking for. newlinechar  newlinechar So what does this mean for boosting the archetype? newlinechar  newlinechar If you're playing casually, you'd probably do well with a 6th land because you can afford to wait a small while/have less dependable draws. You get the full range of domain cards from earlier sets as well as the new. newlinechar   newlinechar Modern has the severe issue of not containing many of the earlier, more powerful domain cards. The only two worth playing are [[Tribal Flames]] and Tromp the Domains. You don't really have a cohesive win condition other than 'Hit them with Tribal Flames, boost creatures with [[Might of Alara]] and use various color pie advantages for the strengths of each'. newlinechar  newlinechar Legacy is where it gets a bit interesting, and this is where I'll introduce the horrifying cards: [[Prismatic Omen]] and [[Nylea's Prescence]]. newlinechar  newlinechar Both of these can get you to full domain on turn 2. [[Draco]], the best Domain card ever printed, now costs 4. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar (Note: [[Draco]] and [[Collective Restraint]] are the only major differences between the card selection in Legacy and Modern, but those are enough to turn this from an OK deck to a moderately-tiered deck). newlinechar  newlinechar So would it have a major difference? Possibly. Is it going to change the entire MTG metagame? Probably not anymore than it could now.

Thanks for commenting again. The extra walls came after the additions to my previous base design. I've had great luck with my layout, even when I'm not sniped those who push have only achieved up to 50% except one guy who dropped a BK. The walls by my TH are aesthetic but the other serve WB purposes and the one in the middle was just to push them around into the bombs. My spring traps have launched more giants than my defenses have killed. The big bomb? Idk... I had extra wall pieces there like next to my cc but WB's haven't been a problem at all. Mass giants or mass archers have been the biggest threat. They drop em to take out that AD knowing they'll also take a crack at that vital 'exposed' wall piece.

Hey, thanks for for commenting. Yeah, it's not particularly clear when just looking at my body. I think I just look a bit smaller and weaker in every muscle group, as opposed to having increased definition (aesthetically I don't think I look too good). In my opinion, highlighting the muscle loss points to how poor fasting is at losing fat but sparing muscle.

That makes a lot of sense when you spell it out for me xD I've spoken to a couple of other guys over the years online in the scat niche, and only a handful of them seemed to care for actual conversation.  newlinechar  newlinechar In my experience, what really throws a lot of women off, including myself, is whenever we're in the mood to want to get to know another scat kinkster in a potential dating sense, the male scat kinksters, who already know we're also into scat, *immediately* want to know all about our sexy scat-scapades and hook up 'with the potential for a relationship later maybe'. It completely puts me off from wanting to get to know the guy. I find it just as obnoxious as going out on a date with a guy I'm just getting to know who, figuring I'm into guys, wants to know about my favorite sexual position. It's just intrusive and sleazy as fuck? If I were putting myself out there as a gal who's just there to hook up and fuck and 'maybe something happens' down the road, then fine, but I never do. So like... what the fuck? Do guys seriously not realize they're ruining their chances with female scat kinksters who would like to date for real by acting like that?  newlinechar  newlinechar Like, *obviously* I like guys, alright? And if you're running into a chick on the scat scene, then she's *obviously* turned on by scat, in whatever fashion she is (which is FAR more of a lead than oldschool hook-ups and dating, btw) so like... *you already know she's into it.* Why the fuck not just set that aside and try to get to know her *seriously* if you're actually interested in seeking a relationship that's not entirely based on sex *with* someone who shares the same kink? I personally can't stand the idea of having a relationship be about sex, or have sex be the foundation of a relationship. I'd *love* to do regular dating with a guy I find interesting who I know also happens to like what I like without it turning into a 'so let's jump in bed asap, or what can I say to lure you into bed/see your snapchats asap?' That's nearly never the foundation of a lasting relationship, which is based more on personalities *first* and sexual compatibility *second*.  newlinechar  newlinechar Jesus Christ.  newlinechar  newlinechar

I don't think that would affect BBCA's schedule though. But you lead into a good point. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm getting a little tired of Eccleston's attitude towards the show and the fans. He wasn't even on the BBC flashback show about his own Doctor. He can't say he didn't know what he was getting into when he accepted the role.  newlinechar  newlinechar If he doesn't want to be part of the show, then the BBC should retcon him out of it. have a multi Doctor story where Capaldi goers back and keeps Hurt from regenerating at the end of DoTD. Hurt would then be THE 9th Doctor and go on to meet Rose and they could show scenes of Hurt being the Doctor in the stories of season 1.  newlinechar  newlinechar The story would end with Hurt regenerating into Tennant. Capaldi would then realize that the change in his timeline makes him the 12th regeneration with none left. So this sets in place the quest for Gallifrey and a new life cycle.

Honestly, I don't even think he truly understands the casual side of things either. newlinechar  newlinechar Think about it, you've got all these new scrolling stages with flash giant hazards going on, 40-50 items all with their own unique effects doing all sorts of exploding flashing things out of nowhere, that is NOT a 'pick up and play' situation. A starter player wants to take things slow and get a handle on the controls and things first, and then later progress onto other things.   newlinechar I'm sure many of you have friends who have a distaste for scrolling stages. IMO the best casual stage in any Smash game has always been Hyrule Temple, and it shows through it's popularity. newlinechar  newlinechar Another reason why I believe Sakurai doesn't understand how casuals play is the emphasis placed of defense. Brawl and Smash4 have incredibly strong defensive games, with shields, shield grabs and rolling being powerful tactics. This slow defensive style is without a doubt the most boring way to play Smash Brothers for the majority of both the Hardcore AND casual audience. Everyone wants to play a game where they can run around at beat things up, especially a casual player. Making defense so powerful works against this. newlinechar  newlinechar He talks about trying to close the gap in skill level between the two groups, but there's never going to be a way to do that. I can reliably beat all of my friends at any smash game, regardless of whatever changes Sakurai tries, and I can't even Wavedash.

Sounds like his take on cyberpunk subgenre which would be a pretty interesting. I was kind of reductionist in my descriptions though there is a lot going on in all of his books.  newlinechar  newlinechar Julian Comstock for example has winks and nods to turn of the century dime novels. Structurally written as Shakespearian/Greek political tragedy. Openly inspired by the history of the roman emperor Julian the Apostate. Not to mention steam punk elements as well, all that on top of being his own take on current dystopian novel trend.  newlinechar  newlinechar I find Burning Paradise to actually his weakest work though. It is a good page turner but not his best. I think half the ideas were left over material and unused ideas from Spin series.

If she thought that she may still have had a chance (i.e. she wasn't 100% sure it was $500), then $450 or $501 would have been a better choice. newlinechar  newlinechar If I were 100% sure of the price, but couldn't choose it because someone else already through it out, because the outcome is the same no matter what I pick, I'd throw out a ridiculous number with no chance of being right.

I have no idea why I think of myself as a man/boy I'm far from a manly man but also not insanely feminine. It really does change my view on the whole black and white Boy/girl thing. It's like we live in a world where we still expect men to go to war/work and women to look after the kids and cook. I think I actually now dislike the term boy/girl for the social implications of black/white. I assume me feeling like a man is due to a combination of all those things and just pure luck of the draw.

Pretty Realistic. newlinechar  newlinechar Consider this, there are more than a few firms that are completely centered around *treating* diseases, not curing , but providing services to treat and symptom manage, but almost nothing goes to cure the disease they champion, and that's not an accident, it's a great business model. Until the day someone announces a cure - and if you don't look to hard, that might not happen for decades - if ever. newlinechar  newlinechar The most ridiculous variant of this of this situation happened with a recent drug, used to cure Hepatitis C, where the drug is ridiculously expensive, 80k for a round of treatment, which will in fact cure you, but will not prevent re-infection, and I get the impression that it may not always work. newlinechar  newlinechar So what happens, after they get many insurance providers to start forking over the 80k per patient per treatment cycle....some underfunded undergraduates came out with a quite promising potential vacccine that treats a variety of the versions of Hepatitis including Hep C.  newlinechar  newlinechar Well, if that vaccine makes it through clinical trials - which is it successfully doing so far, pretty much the company with the 80k cure, is out of luck, and one Pharma firm got served their Karma well before their patent applications were even dry.  newlinechar  newlinechar So while they will say 'Oh we charge ridiculous amounts because of all the research that leads to dead-ends', and 'we have to make it up somewhere?!'. The truth is they make tons of cash and can afford to keep their shareholders in the green, and CEO's jetting from vacation spot to vacation spot.  newlinechar  newlinechar More or less that's it. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not a conspiracy that there are no cures, and there are an unending supply of treatments and such. newlinechar  newlinechar A much more damning indictment may be made of the psychological field, which has gotten into the business of being script-writers inc. newlinechar  newlinechar Basically replacing highly valuable talk-therapy and other forms of active participation where patients walk-through and learn coping mechanisms for the stresses of their lives and replaces that effort with a cocktail of pills that they can take, multiple times a day, for years if not decades.  newlinechar  newlinechar So while some fig-leaf of therapy must remain to give the whole enterprise legitimacy, how many therapists do just enough therapy to charge for a visit, and write a script, coupled with a variety of questionably bad side-effects, many of which are every bit as serious as the problem they are treating it's not a pretty situation.

Simple theory: to have the optimum chance of converting from a header from a corner, you need to be jumping towards the goal (a la Skrtel). newlinechar  newlinechar If there were four players timing runs onto the arranged path of the corner kick, and another three players in the penalty box hustling and ready to score from rebounds, I think we'd do a lot better.

it's such an empty gesture. if Jones had flopped a game earlier, there's no way he would have sat out against Kentucky
The end result is a foul that wouldn't have (and probably should not have)been called. At least with the egregious flop jones had, the play is reviewable. When Harrison gets bumped and takes a shot from a sniper, that isn't reviewable. I don't see how they're fundamentally different other than one being more theatrical. As far as game flow, they're equally bad.

I don't know what to tell you other than try and relax and focus on doing something fun that you love. When my anxiety kicks in sometimes I can't even feel like leaving my room, and just a few months I quit my awesome job because of how bad my panic attacks got. newlinechar  newlinechar It's not a cure-all, and nothing is, but what really helps me to refocus and redirect is to just focus on something simple and something I enjoy. When I'm in that anxiety state and my mind is racing and I'm getting those 'SHOULD' feelings like I SHOULD do this, or I NEED to do this, then that's the last damn thing I should do as chances are I'm going to do something stupid and impulsive, and it's only a short term fix to cool my anxious feeling. newlinechar  newlinechar Instead I'll play a video game. Or watch a youtube video. Some people say you SHOULD meditate, or you NEED to go for a walk and let your mind cool down. That makes me feel worse. I'd rather fuck shit up in a video game, sprint for a mile, or scream in my shower to cool down than doing something much more passive.  newlinechar  newlinechar So just find something you love to do, focus on that, and once you start to come back down then take that next step to something that's a bit more challenging for you.

Wow very sap, much beautiful. An incredible insight into the memories that have been long forgotten of 2014.

We're still on the metaphorical football team and the cheerleaders are still waiting for us to make that big catch.

Not all Christians are like Jesus, not all male TRPs treat women as peers. You are discrediting an entire message because of your own personal bias...just like I'm getting downvoted in my comments.  I'd say my tone had been fairly neutral. newlinechar  newlinechar There are major flaws with the gender roles that our culture imposes on us, just look at the divorce rates. Something is NOT right, don't you agree?  Why do women seem to grow unhappier as they age? Why do men seem to grow happier as they age? Why do women like the bad boys? Why does it take so long for women to appreciate the nice guys? What is the incentive to marry from a successful bachelors perspective? newlinechar  newlinechar What is red pill for me?  I treat a woman as my peer, and I support social and economic equality between sexes.  I do not provide handouts to a woman because she is pretty or owns a vagina (no free drinks).  When I judge a woman I am interested in, I take away the fact that she possesses a vagina and her ability to offer sex, and I judge her based on her complete character. I search for ambitious and classy partners, not grown up children with expectations of entitlement. Sex/attention is not a currency that can be bartered.  You want to offer sex, then I offer you sex in exchange. I search for women who can find happiness within themselves, not ones that expect me to make them happy. Chivalry is condescension hidden under a guise of benevolence.  How is a man expected to respect a woman when he is programmed to believe they are fragile little butterflies that can't take care of themselves?  There's a thing called being nice and respectful, and there's a thing called Chivalry. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not blaming women.  I'm blaming behavior, behavior known in the TRP community as blue pill behavior. Both genders play into blue pill behavior.  Women are subconsciously raised that way, as are men who serve as the enablers. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, I'd like to add that I'm not trying to defend the subreddit /r/TheRedPill, I'm defending the message of taking the red pill. It's a philosophy, not a women bashing club.  It's also known as MGTOW, or a man going his own way.  Reddit's /r/TheRedPill has many men going through an anger phase, I just have the patience and understanding to ignore the misogynistic venting and see the message for what it is. newlinechar  newlinechar Downvote away my peers. newlinechar

I think this topic deserves a little more explaining... especially for someone who is new to bonsai. It isn't impossible if you can move it out during the warm season, especially for some tropicals. Yes it will be much harder, especially with material like this. I think you're exaggerating when you say that bonsai doesn't work indoors. I know people who keep bonsai indoors seasonally and year round. It requires work, but its not impossible. Where do you draw the line? Does a greenhouse count as indoors?

&gt; Property rights do not supersede other rights. newlinechar  newlinechar He never said that they did.

If they don't want a gun on their property, they have the right to say don't come on my property. It's not a matter of gun rights &gt; property rights or vice versa, it's a matter of 'my property, my rules. If you don't like it, get the fuck out'.

It is not necessary- or even reasonable- to tear down one author's work to build up another's. I take particular issue with 'little more than a conservative vision of the status quo, an adventure that brings its hero “There and Back Again,” rather than into a world where experience means you can’t go home again.' Maybe if we were talking solely about The Hobbit, sure, that fits. But the article clearly refers to the entire Tolkein mythology, and one of the main themes of the four hobbits' journeys is that there can be no going back. It's not even subtle, the hobbits talk about it a few times. newlinechar  newlinechar To be fair to the magazine, a lot of this is attributed to Moorcock himself, so whatever. That's just, like, your opinion, man.

This is something I've always wondered - wouldn't it be easier if every score was out of a round number? e.g LSAT is out of 100, MCAT is out of 100, standardized tests are out of 100, credit score is out of 1000... newlinechar  newlinechar The only problem that would create for me is that the scores don't seem unique. Knowing the MCAT is 3-45, the ACT is 1-36, the SAT is 600-2400, and the LSA is 120-180 makes each test more unique. newlinechar  newlinechar This, obviously, isn't an answer, but it's just something I noticed...

When you condemn a group while they are respectful of the system, they start feeling disenfranchised. People will sympathize with the outcasts and the outcasts will get radicalized. newlinechar  newlinechar Now this is the part where I say I am not as knowledgeable of German politics as I perhaps should be. However, notice where I said 'too radical'. NPD are essentially neo-nazis, which, especially with Germany's history, fits easily into the 'dangerously radical' category. newlinechar  newlinechar However, these protests are not entirely NPD. Many are normal citizens who oppose immigration (a sentiment I very much share) and these reactions throw them under the bus and into the hands of NPD. newlinechar  newlinechar

I love how they kept [Yotsugi (the doll)](http://myanimelist.net/character/57499/Yotsugi_Ononoki) at the end because it pretty much translated to a declared fuck you and middle finger to the expectations of [Oshino Ougi](http://myanimelist.net/character/90393/Ougi_Oshino) and the company who's been messing with all the characters. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm also very stoked to how all the characters are wanting to not be 'proper,' they're so meta enough to defy the typical writer's expectations for a conclusion or purpose in an arc.  It's also intentional by the author -Nisio, so it's like meta meta, or something like that.  I'm not sure if there's a term for that or I just have a terrible vocabulary bank.  Anyways, I'm stoked for whatever is going to be next because it seems like the characters are all going to try to be more meta and unpredictable onwards. newlinechar  newlinechar The significance of Tadatsuri and Yozuru not being able to touch the ground because of paranoia or a curse was definitely interesting.  I always thought that Yozuru was trying to not touch the ground because she wants to look down upon Koyokoyo but that seems to not be the case.  I'm guessing they'll touch upon this more later since that wasn't the focus of the arc. newlinechar  newlinechar So, does anyone know if the zoom in Arararagi's neck with two bite marks like a vampire near the end will mean anything in the future?  I'm starting to think Shinobu bit him right before Koyomi was about to fight but Shinobu didn't expect that Tadasuri (I can't spell/remember his name - the guy who kidnaps little girls) to blow up from Yotsugi.  Unless... Koyomi has turned into a vampire and couldn't go back... too much speculation at this point. newlinechar  newlinechar I liked the soundtrack, it definitely accompanied some great moments.  I also was definitely not bored with the dialogue since I found it to be quite engaging.  If I could I would've liked to slow every frame down and ponder on what they were trying talking about but that'll take a while so that'll happen again during my rewatch in the future. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, the relation between Yotsugi and an idol made me lol.  I wonder if they were trying to make fun of the idol things or pander to it... Poe's law. newlinechar  newlinechar Overall, this was quite enjoyable for me and made my day a little bit better and enjoyable.

&gt; If they decide to use Asgard and Nordic myths I could see them doing a nice link to Arendelle then, and needed the help of Elsa and Anna in that scenario. newlinechar  newlinechar I would love to see that. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; ...there was a lot of positive stuff regarding the frozen arc newlinechar  newlinechar That's great to know.  If Once fans enjoyed the Frozen arc too maybe there's a better chance of Anna and Elsa returning. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Oh I see, the internet lied to me then. newlinechar  newlinechar It does that on occasion. :P newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Yeah, as long as there's no contradiction it would be fine. I too want some canonical Frozen stuff, as I always said, for me Frozen didn't feel like the closure to an story, but the opening of a greater one. newlinechar  newlinechar Exactly.  It feels to me like the story was just abandoned after the first arc, and I need more. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Although some AUs wouldn't be bad, perhaps getting the story with Evil Elsa and whatnot. newlinechar  newlinechar You mean like the original concept for Frozen that basically branches off from Let it Go with Elsa becoming a villain?

Would you support a law that penalized pregnant women who failed to undergo abortion if their partner died early into their pregnancy, or pregnant women who failed to undergo abortion when their partner was known to be inaccessible for the purposes of child support? newlinechar  newlinechar Unless you support that statement in its entirety, you're accepting that it is morally and legally acceptable for someone to bring a child into the world with the understanding that the child will not have the resources and benefits associated with having two parents.  Given that this is acceptable, it's illogical to accept that a mother is not free to make the same choice in a case where the father is theoretically available but has preemptively disowned the child; in doing so, you must by nature validate the father's decision to do so.  To illustrate the point, if you accepted the first statement as true, you would have to accept that a woman who failed to undergo abortion despite the knowledge that her male partner would be unavailable to provide support for the child (regardless of why) would *herself* be engaging in an act that should rightly be punishable by law.  The wording's convoluted, I know, so it may take a couple tries, but it does make sense.  (I'm not calling you stupid, I'm calling my wording awkward.) newlinechar  newlinechar Basically, either it's acceptable for someone to unilaterally decide that a child will come into the world with only one parent or it isn't.  If it isn't, you have to throw the book at not just voluntary single mothers, but widows as well.  If it is, that decision cannot be meaningfully divided by gender, especially because a woman has the option of abortion in response to such a decision by her partner. newlinechar  newlinechar Justice is allowing both men and women to make an affirmative choice whether to become parents based on the limitations implied by their biology.  There is no justice in allowing women the right to abortion while holding men legally responsible for a decision they had no part in making.  I know I'm not being particularly eloquent here, but from where I'm standing this should pretty much be a no-brainer.

&gt;Have you found anything that affords you the solitude you crave and fulfills your need for meaning? newlinechar  newlinechar Actually, yes.  I've mentioned this before in other threads, but I used to work as an animator in a small team, which worked really well for me. I got tired of the hours and the nature of some of the projects, so now I work on my own from my home office doing animation, design, and some code.  It gives me the privacy and flexibility I need, but it does lack some of the small team dynamics I like.  It's not very fulfilling work on a 'soul' level, so over the past few years I've started working on a farm a few days a week during the growing season, since it gets me outside, working with other people and my hands, and it is more in line with what I want to be doing on a larger scale (sustainable agriculture, eliminating urban food deserts). newlinechar  newlinechar I still like my main design and animation job--it's fun and pays the bills--but the farming is my passion.  If something is important to you, you will find a way to fit it into your life.  There are ways for you to hold down a job and also write.  A friend of mine who wanted to be a writer simply started getting up an extra hour each day and used that time to write before she went to work.  It's been an amazing transformation for her, and it wasn't a huge lifestyle change and left time for her more boring, but lucrative, job. Within a year she got a short story published in a journal, which is awesome! newlinechar  newlinechar Have you considered that you don't need to retool your skillset, but simply change how you use it? For instance, instead of a stressful commercial kitchen, have you considered being a private chef, or giving small private cooking classes?  If you could flip your perspective and make it more interpersonal or about teaching people how to improve their lives through eating better, you might get more satisfaction out of it (some infj friendly things).  There are a lot of companies, one called sidetour.com, where I've taken small, private classes from people in their homes or businesses, and it's been great.  You get a big cut of the money, yet can control the content, schedule, and size of the group.  I don't know, you sound like a talented person, you just might need to apply them in a different environment/purpose and then fit what you're passionate about in where you can.

Someone being sexist towards women is contributing towards oppressions.

Flat Pen is the same use no matter how little or how much armor the enemy has, so it's static in value. newlinechar  newlinechar Percentage pen will go UP in value, the more armor they have. So if you're comparing Brutalizer (+10 Flat Pen), Cleaver (+10 Flat Pen and up to 25% pen), and Ghostblade (+20 Flat Pen) with Last Whisper (35% Pen) then it'll naturally be more beneficial to go for Armor Pen when they have more armor, and Flat Pen when they have less armor. newlinechar  newlinechar The question is where the breaking point is. newlinechar  newlinechar At 50 Armor newlinechar  newlinechar * Last Whisper reduces it to 32.5 newlinechar  newlinechar * Cleaver reduces it to 37.5 -27.5 depending on the number of stacks. newlinechar  newlinechar * Ghostblade reduces it to 30 newlinechar  newlinechar So as you can see here, Last Whisper falls pretty close in the middle here, maybe a bit on the low end. So I'd say it's safe to say, anything at or above sixty armor will be killed faster with a LW when compared to the other Armor Pen items. This holds true even MORE so if you took Armor Pen runes, as those are ALSO percentage based, which stacks with LW. With the above example, Armor Pen Runes + LW would take the 50 armor down to 23, far less than anything else.

I beg to differ. I would consider myself a layman when it comes to the system, and yet even I know what it means for your public record if you are convicted of a crime. That's another reason I don't buy his 'poor me' attitude in this interview. He can't even pretend that Serial is the first time he's not been able to get a job due to his past. Background checks are a thing, and he plead guilty to after the fact accessory murder. Even if he got off on probation, that sticks with you.

I have to disagree here. newlinechar  newlinechar Who else has the responsibility to support the child if not the father, the man who brought that child into the world in the first place? What would be more 'just' in your opinion? Making taxpayers pay for someone else's mistake? Just making the mother support the child alone and letting them live in poverty? newlinechar  newlinechar I agree that making the man help support his child might not be convenient for him, but it is certainly justifiable and makes perfect sense in my opinion.

Why is learning the facts and details important though? Have you read Lies My Teacher Told Me? Great book, must read for any American who was lied to throughout school. :P Part of the point it makes is that American history classes focus a lot on dates. Like, put these in order, and it lists events that all happened around the same time that are totally unrelated. Or it makes you memorize in what year this and that happened, instead of talking about the *point* of those things happening. Critical thinking is more important that fact memorizing. But the fact is, it's easier to test facts than critical thinking, so our 'Must Pass All the Children On The State Tests Or Will Lose Money' policy. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course the debate is more complicated than this. I just think it's stupid to focus on dates and details that kids'll forget a minute after the test. Humans are made to remember ideas and how things made them feel, not strings of digits that are floating in the void, useless and irrelevant. newlinechar  newlinechar And of course not everyone can debate at once, but the teacher can nick on their chart whenever a student uses a unique correct fact, and near the end asks the students that haven't spoken up enough to talk. It would not only encourage on the spot fact recall, but speaking skills and interpersonal communication.

Ectomycorrhizal fungi, the mycorrhizal fungi that tend to associate with trees and form mushrooms, have a very very *very* limited ability, if any ability at all, to extract carbon from organic matter like decomposers do.  When they form a mycorrhiza with a plant, they are dependent upon the plant to provide them carbon with which they can grow and reproduce.  Because of this inability to decompose, their germinating spores must rely almost solely on stored nutrients to grow until they form a mycorrhiza, and hence must germinate quite close to an uncolonized root tip to have a chance at surviving.  I think it's impossible for them to form a big mycelial mat without a tree partner. newlinechar  newlinechar I think that lots of ectomycorrhizal fungi can be cultured, but you need to do it on a substrate that has very simple nutrients, like straight glucose, in order to get around their inability to decompose. newlinechar  newlinechar I have heard a few anecdotes about people repeatedly applying large quantities of spore slurry from a desired mushroom at the bases of trees, and getting those mushrooms popping up in that area in a year or two, but I haven't seen any proper study of how effective that might be.   newlinechar  newlinechar If you're the patient type, you could try coating seeds in spores of your chosen mushrooms, planting them, and seeing how fast the mushrooms pop up.  Probably would take years, though…
I really hope they don't spoil the set.  newlinechar  newlinechar People have talked about this a lot, but spoiler season is a basically one giant advertisement, and the people who are hurt by leaks aren't the people at WotC, it's the smaller websites and people.

My cats do this when one comes back smelling like vet, and one will freak and lash out at whichever cat is nearby for awhile. I usually put a tiny dot of cornstarch (*not* talc) baby powder on the top of everybody's nose so they all smell the same. I'll also brush my angry kitty some, then brush whoever went to the vet (without pulling any fur out of the brush) right after so the other cat smells more like him. There's still some tension, but far less attacking. newlinechar  newlinechar You can also bring in some interactive toys and get them playing side by side (not together at first) and give them all treats in the same room as each other.

My science is probably off, but as the speed of anything increases, time slows down for that traveling object. so as the solar system and galaxy zoom through space, couldn't we find the center from which they are zooming by seeing what opposite vector produces causes time to go by the fastest?  newlinechar  newlinechar for example: newlinechar we [arth] are moving through space in an unknown direction at whatever speed (lets call it vector X) from an unknown point. Our time goes by at 1 second per second. If we send probes in all directions from ours, they will be moving with a vector of X + Whichever-vector-we-gave-that-probe. If the vector of a given probe is opposite of the vector from which we are moving from on a scale of space, wouldn't time for that probe speed up? and likewise, the opposite for the probe sent with the same vector?

What surgery have you had? There's plenty that *can* go wrong with even minor surgery like wisdom teeth extraction (the surgeon could damage one of the lingual nerves, for example). Most of the potential complications with surgery only manifest during recovery, such as surgical site infection, sepsis, haemorrhage, bad scarring, nerve damage, organ failure, etc. During the actual surgery, the risk of something going wrong heaviyl depends on the patient's presurgical state (which also obviously affects perioperative morbidity &amp; mortality), but the general complications include things such as haemorrhage, anaesthetic awareness, aspiration of gastric contents, the 'can't ventilate/can't intubate' emergency described in this thread, etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also the reason why the patient needs surgery is usually a contributor to the stress, and the fear that the surgery just won't be successful.

Okay, I'm really confused.  I thought libertarians wanted to reduce the government because it is inefficient and clumsy.  Why in the world would we support cops not doing their job?  Yes, there are less arrests and we don't have to be afraid of the big, bad government but now we have tons of unnecessary cops.  Isn't that just more inefficiencies in the government that we should be opposing?  I would celebrate a nosedive in arrests from fewer cops being hired but not from cops refusing to do what we are paying them to do.

Honestly, if you watch Maccabi Tel Aviv games when Blatt was the coach, the offense is amazingly ran.

Well, not to wash down your comment, but even if you provide an intelligent or eloquent prompt, most of the time it is very rare to find a corresponding that will give the same level or even higher level of intelligence back as a response. newlinechar  newlinechar Personally, I've tried writing up my own prompts with enough detail to create a background for a good roleplay.

Look at the rail. The top, where the wheel comes in contact, is silver and smooth.

Any regularly used rail will have a shiny strip on the top where the train wheels meet the rail. Look at a bend.

'Oh NOOOO!' said Cow. It was horrible: her beautiful Rose Bowl picnic was being torn apart in front of her eyes! Not a cloud in the sky and yet here was this sudden vortex of wind, strong enough to lift her EZ-UPs 50 feet into the turbid air! Roses, bags, tents and tarps lifted into the air, bowing, twisting and flipping within the grasp of the gaseous whirlwind. Cow was beside herself. She raised her hooves to her broad, flat forehead in udder shock. A friend clamped onto her arm. 'Cow!' Suzy cried at her friend's fuzzy, palmate ears. 'Cow! We've got to leave here! It isn't safe!'  newlinechar  newlinechar Cow was numb,  not recognizing her human friend's plea. In her mind, a sound heaved itself out of her memory  like a dead man's last breath.

When you're talking about physical traits, I'm glad that I have a womanly voice, face and shape, sure. I'd feel a little miffed if someone told me I was manly in some physical way because being physically womanly pleases me. I like to look traditionally feminine with long hair and shaved legs and makeup and dresses; it's fun. I totally get why a guy who wants to look physically manly would be unhappy at being told he looked feminine in some fashion. Nothing sexist about wanting to look like a magnificent hunk of hot hot manliness/womanliness.  newlinechar  newlinechar When you're talking about professions and capabilities, though, you're treading on far shakier ground because these things aren't just superficial; they have very real implications for how a person lives, and saying that, for example, having women enter STEM fields en masse makes some men uncomfortable cannot be easily solved by saying, 'Okay, ladies, back to the secretarial pool with you.' That genie is out of the bottle, and she's working in your lab or studio or boardroom.  newlinechar  newlinechar When you describe wanting to keep women out of male-centric parts of life, the unfortunate side effect is keeping women *down*. I'm not saying that's what you intend; I don't believe you do, and I appreciate your having a real discussion about something I'm seeing in a new light. That's the net effect, though, of suggesting men must have somewhere away from women to retreat to retain their manliness.  newlinechar  newlinechar While women have visibly moved into areas that used to be exclusively male, men have quietly moved into areas that used to be overwhelmingly female domains. Nurses, teachers, stay-at-home parents -- guys can do these things now, and as far as I know, there hasn't been a huge backlash from women claiming it makes them feel unfeminine to have male nurses and nannies. No one has said, 'Now that men take an unabashed delight in caring for their children, how can I still feel feminine?'  newlinechar  newlinechar That's what I'm getting at: There's still a presumption there, unconscious though it may be, that femininity is less than masculinity, that women therefore lower the intrinsic value of something by making it less masculine when they participate in 'traditional men things.' You wonder 'If anyone can do it, how is it masculine,' but I don't know that any woman thinks that way about femininity. I don't think I'm less feminine if you, a man, do something I traditionally do. I don't think we ever tell other girls they 'hug like a boy' or 'sew like a boy' or 'cook like a boy' and mean it as an insult.  newlinechar  newlinechar By the way, 'you throw like a girl' is an insult -- ask any third-grader. It's an insult, and it's *abso-fucking-lutely* meant to be one. So is 'you cry like a girl,' 'you run like a girl,' 'you dance like a girl,' and any of its corollaries. These things aren't said to girls and women as an accurate and neutral assessment of their skills; they're said to boys and men to demean them because in the speaker's mind, being compared to a girl is *a very bad thing*.  newlinechar  newlinechar I want to live in a world in which doing things 'like a girl' is not automatically considered less good than doing things 'like a boy.' When that happens, maybe we'll stop worrying about whether having a woman as a company's CEO somehow takes away from men's masculinity. newlinechar  newlinechar

You can't expect everyone to love something the way you do.  Broken mess of MCC aside, you can't expect something to remain in the form you love it most forever unless you actively keep it that way.  The logic that something is different and not what you loved so therefore everyone else should shun the new is flawed.  If Halo can change to appeal to a wider audience then that's what they'll do.  10 new fans beats losing someone who is stuck in 10 years ago.  
I don't think that was rude, no worries.

As a musician I agree completely.  Music is a cultural phenomenon that **builds** upon the art of previous generations.

The better outcome would be that no one died, and the accused was given a speedy trial and judged by a jury of his peers, as is his right under the 6th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. newlinechar  newlinechar There's a world of difference between true defensive acts, and standing your ground simply so that you can play judge, jury, and executioner yourself.

I don't mean to piss in your cheerios. We're all scratching our heads how to rebalance things. Because of the recent changes to the demo's pipes and loch'n'load I find myself spamming from medium to long ranges these days...and ultimately accomplishing nothing. newlinechar  newlinechar Choke points used to be awesome as you had opportunities to ambush people. Now you just get spammed out. The extra pipe for the loch gives the demo another opportunity to miss while dealing out massive damage.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you took one random rocket for 60 damage coming up to the corner. It'll only take 2 loch'n'load pills to kill you. Sure the demo's aim has to be solid, but if you're spinning and shooting your minigun, your movement is reduced and there's no way to keep up with the damage that even a mediocre demo outputs.  newlinechar  newlinechar To put it in simplest terms: Operating at 240 HP as a heavy is a disadvantage with his current minigun nerf.

&gt; what can a man ever give or that offer a woman that has her life in order? newlinechar  newlinechar Let's see, how about his company, his wit, his support, his charm, his intelligent conversation, his thoughtfulness and especially his love? I didn't marry my husband because I wanted someone to put my life in order or take care of me; I married him because I love him and he loves me. We now have a house together, we help each other with our careers, we go through life as a couple.  newlinechar  newlinechar He 'fits into that picture' because I want him there and he wants me there.  newlinechar  newlinechar I mean, I guess if you think the only woman worth having is one who doesn't have her shit together and will therefore be dependent on you, then maybe a woman with a career and a home feels like a threat. To someone who wants to go through life with an equal whom he respects as well as loves, her having her life in order isn't really a bad thing. 
I like how you wrote monotone voice, like it wasn't a given. 
As a gamer and someone who has been calling out SJW crap before it went under that banner, it's pretty accurate. It's clearly a broader trend, and an extension of internet culture that's been brewing for years. Some of us use the internet differently from others, but SJWs in particular want to dictate how others use *their* portions.  newlinechar  newlinechar And a big part of that is we had a society online where status was practically non-existent. Where it did exist was via merit. You could earn trust by acting responsibly. You didn't need to have your real name attached to a website to want it to run well. The sites that cared for users the most succeeded. newlinechar  newlinechar The more people got used to attaching their real identity online, the more they felt under fire. The internet can be a hostile place. Instead of embracing it, or building a wall and enclosing themselves, they chose to try and change everyone else's behavior. They're basically wading into battle and then crying about being shot at, all the while they're firing back. newlinechar  newlinechar There's always been crybabies online. The difference is, we used to tell them to join the subculture or find a group they got along with better. And it worked. Now it's 'you can't say that, you can't do that, you can't tell me I'm not in your club, and once I'm in by self-declaration I expect you to meet my needs'. It's much more self-centered than an internet dominated by lack of identity. newlinechar  newlinechar It's perhaps something of an inevitability. You always have the frontier and the cityfolk. The people of the frontier explore, and it's rough, but they have the best time of it they can. Eventually, where riches are struck, the cityfolk move in and carpetbag the place. They 'civilize' it. What we're seeing now is an attempt by normalfags to 'civilize' and tame the internet so they can have it. Except they're missing what made the internet so great in the first place.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's the equivalent of looking at a house, and saying, 'How new and awesome! I want to buy it and live there! But, I miss the old place. Can we move all the furniture in and redecorate a little?'. They like the idea of something being *theirs* more than appreciating it for what it is.

There was a lot of speculation about that and MAYBE it did, but honestly, Ledger was lost in that role.

I had never gotten bored of looking at the sunset. Or sunrise, for that matter. Something about the way the colours blended together, it was beyond words. I figured up here, after these three years, it would have gotten boring. newlinechar  newlinechar It seems to have now. It had been a long month since I even bothered looking out of the so-called two-by-two window. The brilliant purples and blues against the Earth’s horizon were now just glaring and distracting. From just moving around I knew how the light shuffled in and out, the shadows that it left behind in the station. newlinechar  newlinechar Today, those shadows were slightly off. I found myself peering out of that window again – it was like seeing an old friend – and looked over at the Earth’s curvature. It was the same. newlinechar  newlinechar Then I noticed something in my peripheral. A blinking. I looked over, and found continental China slowly blinking away, as if the embers of the night were being stamped out. It was gradual, then it begun to spread – like a disease – it blacked out Japan, then India and quickly headed west to Europe. I gripped the window handles dumbfounded. What was I looking at? What the hell was going on? newlinechar  newlinechar I pushed at the panel and floated over towards control.  newlinechar  newlinechar “Houston, you there?” newlinechar  newlinechar “Yep, hearing you loud and clear.” newlinechar  newlinechar “I’m observing some strange phenomena in the eastern continents. Looks like a giant power outage. Am I going crazy?” newlinechar  newlinechar There was silence on the other end. newlinechar  newlinechar “Houston, you copy?” newlinechar  newlinechar Not even a crackle. I worriedly pulled back to the window and found America blacked out too. The Earth was silent. If I didn’t know any better, I would have said the Earth was literally turning black too. Something perfectly spherical. It was surreal, and now I was certain I was hallucinating.  newlinechar  newlinechar Again I pushed back to control and tried every other channel I could. Finally a Chinese space station relayed back a message, asking me what was going on. I replied saying I had no idea, but was relieved it wasn’t just me seeing it. Feeling dejected, I once more anxiously floated over to the window. The Earth was a solid black ball. It looked fantastical, something beyond nature.  newlinechar  newlinechar Then it opened it’s eyes. newlinechar

That sounded pretty cathartic to let out, I hope it felt good to vent :P newlinechar  newlinechar I really feel your pain though, even if I'm not directly affected by the 'horny guys just wanting to fuck' issue. You see it time and again on sites with a sexual slant; guys whose idea of a good opening is 'hey bitch u wana c my cock im so hrd 4 u' or who think that unsolicited photos of their dicks make for good conversation starters. It pains me to see it, because it can't *possibly* work with anyone in possession of more than two brain cells and only serves to create a gross environment for people who would actually quite like to chat about more than just fucking, thank you very much. newlinechar  newlinechar I think the thing I've come to realize is that a huge majority of guys who frequent places like this don't actually have any desire to make it anything *other* than fantasy. They want to talk about it, want to imagine it, want to hear other people describe it (as long as they make it sexy enough and don't let real life intrude too much) and want to watch it, but present them with the reality of a relationship involving scat (or whatever kink they happen to be into) and most seem to lose interest completely. These guys come here to fan the flames of their fantasies; to jack off while they make believe and imagine some absurd, unattainable ideal where sex is the only goal and what happens after an orgasm is they close the browser window. I just don't get it, myself. You have this amazing opportunity to engage with people in an open, honest and above all understanding scenario, and people waste it chasing after a quick, easy orgasm. newlinechar  newlinechar Jesus Christ indeeed.

Go buy a nice jacket and feign confidence. From one not that great looking guy to another, confidence goes a long way with most women. Also try maintaining eye contact when you speak with anyone. It makes you a more dominant presence. Like don't be weird and wide eyed, just push through that feeling of discomfort that comes with prolonged eye contact. They're feeling it too. It's weird but trust me it will help. Shitting on yourself won't. Just talk to women whenever you can in a non creepy place like the bus or down a dark street. You got this man, I believe in you.

I'm likely -1 on this proposal. I've held a different position in the past, but by now I'm thoroughly convinced that if we introduce scalar typehints, they should be strict. No wiggling, no casting. newlinechar  newlinechar Apart from being consistent with the existing behavior of typehints and being what the majority of the vocal community wants, it is also possible to reason about strict typehints statically. newlinechar  newlinechar This means that an IDE or other tool will be able to perform meaningful analysis based on typehinted functions. E.g. if you pass the result of a `string` function to an `int` parameter, your code is definitely wrong and you can be told so. Loose (casting) typehints do not offer this possibility, because a string can be or can not be a valid input to an int parameter depending on the exact value. newlinechar  newlinechar For the same reason loose typehints are also more fragile. Code that worked in casual testing during development will fail in production when unexpected, improperly validated user input is encountered. With strict typehints on the other hand it is very likely that code working with one input will also work with all other possible inputs, because the type check is not value-dependent. newlinechar  newlinechar The ability to statically check typehints is rather important to me. I think much of the usefulness of this feature would be lost without the ability to check correct usage with tooling.
In that case, be careful, it's not a very friendly place.  newlinechar  newlinechar Keep your phone on you. It can be a light of Eärendil for you, showing you that there's still light in the world as you walk in dark places.

Can confirm. Was at the premiere in Cannes. After the movie when we gave it a standing ovation, Schultz was in tears. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I just need to say, though, that I honestly think the homoeroticism is something that I think critics are reading way too much into. When I saw the movie, I never ever thought there was any homosexual nature in the relationship between du Pont and Schultz. I always got the creepy factor to be from the main theme of the film being how little the rich look at the poor. In fact, I think sexualizing their relationship REALLY undercuts that major point of the movie.

This comment makes no sense at all. The OPs argument is based on the idea that the fetus is a human life, which there is no consensus on. Neither is there a consensus that it is not one.

Address what he is claiming, and counter it, don't just dismiss it. newlinechar  newlinechar Assume a fetus is a human life with rights. In your previous comment you say newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Make the decisions you want for you and your family, not me and mine. newlinechar  newlinechar OP responded with newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If a man viewed his wife as his property and chose to kill her, would you be wrong to impose your will on him by defending her life newlinechar  newlinechar It is clear that a woman is not the property of a man, and so the husband has no right to kill her. We can all agree on this. The point of this statement is to draw parallels between the wife and a fetus. The premise that is being argued is that the fetus has rights, in much the same way the woman does.  newlinechar  newlinechar But a man killing his wife is none of your business, in the same way that a woman aborting a fetus is none of my business. So should a third party, who is not invested in the outcome, be allowed to intervene to protect the rights of somebody, or should they only do what they want for themselves and their family, and leave you to you and your family, even if its a violation of rights.  newlinechar  newlinechar So address what is being argued. Can a third party, in a libertarian society, use force (either their own or through the state) to protect the rights of somebody from being violated?

I'm in my early 30s, and one of the reasons I wanted to get in shape was because I was feeling old before my time. I spent several really rough years being hard on myself and managing my stress with food, with the inevitable consequences. While I'm in a much better place now, I'm still carrying more weight on my frame than I should. I've tried other workouts, but I seem to have a problem where I push myself, get hurt and have to sit out for a while. newlinechar  newlinechar I knew DDP Yoga was different the second I started trying out the moves. I was able to really get my heart rate up and push myself, but I never felt like I was in danger of injuring myself since the moves were nice and slow. I am so excited about this system and can't wait to see what results I get in 2015.

Why would you apologize for being the bearer of bad news? Unless you are directly responsible, there is no need to say you're sorry. It seems to be a mincing of words. Nothing you say, especially 'I'm sorry' is going to lessen the blow. Besides, most people are must more resilient that given credit for. There's no need to start with an apology.

Yah. One from a couple of weeks ago. newlinechar  newlinechar I went to target with her to help her pick out a few Xmas gifts. I'm pregnant and all she wanted to do was look at baby stuff, even though I told her I'm on limited time. We only had picked out one gift before I had to leave. She starts complaining that I didn't help her at all. I said 'I would have, but you refused to leave the baby section.' She tells me to stay longer and I say that I can't because my little brother is coming over for dinner. She asked why I didn't invite her, and I said its because my brother and I never get to spend time together and we decided to hang out while my SO was out of town. She then invites herself, and I said that I prefer it just being my brother and I. She says 'God, you act like a teenager. It's not lame to hang out with your mom!' I said 'I'm spending time with you right now. Tonight is just going to be my brother and I.' newlinechar  newlinechar She then moves on to Christmas plans and asks what we're doing with our dad. I said we're probably doing breakfast with my grandparents, but my grandmother had surgery and we weren't sure if she was going to be out of the hospital. newlinechar  newlinechar Cue meltdown in the middle of target. newlinechar  newlinechar 'No! I get breakfast! It's Christmas morning and I refuse to not have my kids on Christmas morning.' newlinechar  newlinechar 'Mom, we're adults now.' newlinechar  newlinechar 'I don't care! Our custody agreement says that I get you Christmas morning!' newlinechar  newlinechar 'Mom. We are ADULTS. Old custody agreements don't matter.' newlinechar  newlinechar 'I don't care! I'm getting my kids on Christmas morning! And your grandparents shunned me and quit inviting me to their breakfast!' newlinechar  newlinechar 'That's because you and their son have been divorced for 11 years. Besides, it's not like we're waking up for Santa gifts.' newlinechar  newlinechar 'I don't care!' newlinechar  newlinechar 'That's too bad. If they want breakfast, they get breakfast. I see you at three different parties every Xmas, and I only see dad for one. Their plan will come first because its their only plan.' newlinechar  newlinechar Moving on, we find out that my grandmother will probably still be in the hospital, so I tell my mom that we will do breakfast with her and lunch with dad. This is about a week before Christmas. newlinechar  newlinechar On Christmas Eve she texts me and says 'I bought a turkey so we can do lunch, so just do breakfast with your dad.' newlinechar  newlinechar Whatthefuck. I almost expected this. She loves to try to mess up anything that we do with our dad. I wrote back and said that other family members are going to his lunch and its too late to reschedule. She says 'But I bought a turkey!' I told that's her fault since we had been planning on breakfast. She then switches to 'But you'll be spending more time with your dad than with me!' newlinechar  newlinechar So. Fucking. What. I reminded her, again, that we see her THREE fucking times for Xmas, and only see our once. I told her she can pick breakfast or dinner, but she can't have lunch. newlinechar  newlinechar She took a moment to bitch about my dad planning lunch in the middle of the day, because what other time of day is lunch supposed to happen? newlinechar  newlinechar She then decides that she wants both breakfast and dinner. I told her I'll be there for breakfast, but not for dinner, and that's the final plan. We go for breakfast the next day and she's like 'I forgot that my oven is broken, so I need you to cook the turkey and bring it back.' newlinechar  newlinechar I told her no, she tried to fuss, but she can't misbehave in front of my stepdad, so she stayed quiet. When it was time for us to leave for my day's house she tried her hardest to stall us and makes us wait, but we just hurried out the door. newlinechar  newlinechar

And this is where the argument falls apart, and falls into a strange hyper secular amoral absolutism. If it is a living person it has rights. If it is not a living person it does not have rights. If it has rights, then you have no authority to kill it. If it does not have rights then you have the authority to terminate the pregnancy.  newlinechar  newlinechar But how can it simultaneously be alive, have rights, and still be okay to kill? That argument makes no sense whatsoever. Why is abortion the one area where it is okay to unilaterally infringe on a person's rights?  newlinechar  newlinechar Its one thing to think you can kill something without rights, its another entirely to assume that you can kill a defenseless person with rights.

Well, for example something like LYAH is generally considered to cover most of the necessary concepts for learning Haskell. So if you aren't finding that it helps you or you're getting stuck, knowing *where* you get stuck can help improve the resources like LYAH that are available.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, not everyone understands the same explanations or gets tripped up by the same issues even when learning a particular concept. So again, I'd invite you to express what you're having problems with! It may be that the question was already answered somewhere (in which case making it more easily accessible may help). It's really hard to say when I don't actually know what you're having trouble with.
Always amusing, but the use of the word mongoloid really bothers me. It's racist and is used to basically say that people from Mongolia are the same as people with down syndrome. It's worse than using the word nigger. It has no business being used casually in a fluff post like that.

I don't think it was necessarily that Terry Pegula wanted to bring in his own people but that most people in Buffalo, including Pegula, weren't sold on Marrone yet. They wanted to see what happened next year. That being said, I don't blame Marrone. I don't think he was the long term answer for us.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, this gives us a chance to interview Frank Reich and see if he's worth giving a shot before someone else snatches him up. This part is a personal fantasy of mine.

I just kinda feel overwhelmed by these criticisms. It seems to be that every day on /r/games or elsewhere I see something negative about the industry. Of course, this is necessary, we do need to warn people and steer them away from making uninformed decisions about the games they play, but at the same time there's just so much bad shit happening.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm getting the impression that how I let opinions decide the games I play is an issue.

/r/buildapc is much more suited to help out than here. Have you tried posting there, yet? newlinechar  newlinechar Some quick critiques though: your build has a lot of pointless extras pushing up the cost.  newlinechar  newlinechar Thermal silver paste and an aftermarket cooler are only needed if you're planning on overclocking.  newlinechar  newlinechar Your PSU is way more than you'll need. A lower wattage PSU will be more efficient with the power draw of that build, and cheaper too. newlinechar  newlinechar You probably won't need a DVD drive. I haven't had one in a build for 2 years now and I haven't ever needed it. USB flash drives are a much cheaper and easier way to move data around these days. newlinechar  newlinechar You won't need an ethernet adapter, it'll be built in to the motherboard, so that can be cut. If you actually do need wireless there are cheaper options available. newlinechar  newlinechar Most importantly though, that video card probably won't be fast enough to drive 3 monitors at decent resolutions and settings at a decent frame rate. Invest more in your video card and less in the pointless extras!

My advice to get her to stop bugging you? Next time she brings it up, say 'who I date is none of your business' and if she pushes it, ignore her.  newlinechar  newlinechar As for moving on, you can move on whenever you feel like it--you're single, you're not obligated to feel or do anything until you're ready.

&gt; The NYPD thinks we've created an unsafe working environment but it's they, themselves, who have created this condition in which they appear to be adversaries. newlinechar  newlinechar I think your half right.  I blame the politicians (i.e. mayors and police chiefs) which set arrest quotas, policy etc. The average cop is just a pawn in a shitty situation. Yes theres corrupt cops and such but its not the norm.  I'm sure theres a few cops out there that have lost passion for their job arresting drug addicts, only to rearrest them later. On top of that if they don't follow the books they get fired or have a lawsuit.  I think the solution involves private insurance and security, however I understand that wont be taken kindly here.
I personally think it's going for the slow bleed, but there's also option #2.  They always talk about 'historical support lines' and what not, and have pretty much pegged $230-250 as their can not break, do or die, support level.  If that breaks, it's definitely possible we see a full crash down to double digits in a couple hours.

I feel like he probably didn't like the way the world was, mostly the separation of the spirit and material world. So I imagine he joined the RL with the intent of changing things (albeit for his own selfish reasons). Then he learned about Wan, Raava and Harmonic Convergence, which led to him formulating his own plan that differed from the RL's. Zaheer even mentioned it was never their plan to have someone fuse with Vaatu. I bet once Unalaq learned of all this, he probably wanted the world thrown into chaos so he could become Unavaatu and rise up as ruler. He was pretty manipulative, so I wouldn't be surprised if he was just trying to use them

If you buy an Animus, that's 6 gold going toward what could have been two drones (also 6 gold). The Animus produces RR per turn, compared to what could have been 2 gold from drones, therefore each R costs 1 gold each. newlinechar  newlinechar Extending the comparison, a conduit costs 4 gold (4/3 drones) and a Blastforge costs 5 gold (5/3 drones), so each G is worth 1 1/3 gold, and each B is worth 1 2/3 gold. It's not relevant whether a resource can be stored; all that means is that if you don't spend your single B for the turn, then you've wasted 1 2/3 gold worth of value.

I am amazed that this seems to be so poorly followed. I live in the UK and guns are pretty much non existent for most of the population. My dad taught me to shoot when I was younger and even though the only guns I ever owned were .22 air pistols or rifles it was the first thing he taught me and he also made sure it was enforced. I always assumed that in the states this would be like knowing the national anthem. Of course we usually only hear about these things when they are not following the rule.

I agree it shouldn't be brought up, in *this* thread. The PM people need to start online riots or something, petitions, outlashes, etc and get their game out there to be heard. It'll be a lot harder (if not impossible) than Melee retracting nintendo's shit decision for EVO (lmao), considering from a nintendo's business perspective that it's a Mod, and Sm4sh is out, and all that other crap. But I feel like I haven't seen a lot of blowout besides the death threats thing, which was stupid because a few people aren't a representation of a whole community, from the PM community after the APEX announcement.  newlinechar  newlinechar After the melee thing happened, the whole gaming world heard about it, but it was much easier because Melee was on the rise, and the hugeeeeeeeee fact that it was a charity crowd fund nearing 90-100k raised. After the PM thing happened, I feel like all I heard about it was on this subreddit via threads (not even huge front page hits either) and scarce random comments spread throughout other gaming subs I'm in. We all preach LeOneUnitXD but in reality it's more so  'Your community tries to fix ur own shit and ur own problems, and we will support you'. And it seems like the PM community did not cause more of an uproar of their exclusion, compared to melee with theirs. But Melee had a much easier time doing so again because of the charity, so it's not a fair comparison lol

I will share my story since I can contribute. I had a septo-rhinoplasti twice. The first time went great. Woke up from surgery didn't know where I was, had a friend drive me home and had the splints in for a week. Getting them out hurt and they pulled huge goops of blood and what not. Second one not as great except for the cartilage from my ear the had to graft for my nose. That hurt extremely bad. Woke up felt great tried to fight the nurse since I hate the state he's from. Then apologized when the drugs wore off. Didn't have splints or anything but got sick that night from the anesthesia. About a week and a half after surgery my nose started bleeding really bad. Like a waterfall for about 30-45 minutes at a time. After a night of that I went to the er and they didn't believe me and put some gel up my nose. About 5 days later I was laying down about to go to sleep and I feel and taste blood running down the back of my throat. I run to the bathroom and blood is pouring out my nose for about 90 minutes. I tell my wife to get my clothes and a bucket because I need to go to the er. I get to the er and they put one iv in each arm and keep putting some liquid up my nose. Next thing I know a doctor comes in with three nurses to put sponges up my nose. They wouldn't let me lean forward because I could pass out from blood loss but every time I lean forward I choke on my blood and can't breath. I keep trying to lean forward but the nurses held me down and I was coughing up blood. I passed out from pain/blood loss/not breathing and when I woke up I was covered in blood in pain about to throw up. A surgeon had to come in and cauterize my nose since there was a small hole in an artery in my nose. About 2 weeks later I smell something very bad. Like rotting flesh/raw sewage and even my friends and wife can smell it. I thought there was an infection so I called my doctor to ask and she was going on vacation so she couldn't see me but referred me to another one. He called three days later on a thursday and told me it might be a booger or an infection but couldn't see me until the next week. The next day I had this terrible taste in my mouth and felt like I had a booger in my nose. the whole day I was blowing my nose and finally something came out. The biggest booger I've ever seen. About 1.5 inches in diameter. That repeated itself every two weeks for about 3 months. Both surgeries failed

Maybe something like a prequel? Follow their lives pre-Majora. It would be interesting to read about how Termina functioned with Darmani and Mikau. Or maybe last year's festival of time? You could showcase some stuff it involved and show just exactly why it's supposed to be a huge deal. Or the fallout been the Gorman brothers! There are so many different storylines that you could work with! Literally the only thing I would not suggest is an Anju Kafei love story. To me, that particular story arc is best left alone, particularly because it was covered the most in the game. We know almost nothing about the characters like the bomber gang, the deku you sell the moon's tear to (how does his wife like the gift he gave up valuable real estate for hmmm?), Honey and Darling (there's a love story that would be kind of interesting), or maybe something specifically about Anju and how it was growing up as the son of a wishy washy mayor. Good Lord the possibilities are endless! Let me know if you need any more help out suggestions! I'd be interested in assisting any way I can! It sounds fun! :)

The only difference between races this time around are their innate racial abilities, such as water breathing on Argonians or Frost Resist on Nords. There is zero reason to play this game with more than one character, really... Every race and gender can obtain maximum stats and can complete every single quest in the game (Besides the Civil War, but both sides are flippin' identical anyway). newlinechar  newlinechar Traditionally, Dunmer (Dark Elves) have always been the 'jack-of-all-trades' race. Their starting bonus to a variety of skills supports this as well (But, all races can easily max all skills). newlinechar  newlinechar Then there is High Elf, who begin with 50 extra Magicka, which can save you 5 levels of attribute allocation. Their ability to quickly regen Magicka once per day is useful, too. newlinechar  newlinechar Orcs are nice because their Berserker Rage ability lets them deal double melee/bow damage, and take half damage for a while.

The tidal acceleration in LEO due to the Sun is about 5*10^-7 m/s^(2).  That comes out to about 3 mm/s of delta-v for one orbital period, or 1 m/s over 20 days.

Where is it? Where? newlinechar  newlinechar My eyes scanned the screen, desperately searching for the video. I couldn’t find it. Everyone’s video is on this site. And I mean everyone. But not mine. So where is it? I must die at some point, right? Right? newlinechar  newlinechar My panic grew. I started to mash at my keyboard, trying to search the site for my name. But nothing. Nothing! newlinechar  newlinechar “Maybe you’re immortal,” Beth said. She’s my girlfriend. As beautiful as can be. Her hair is pitch black, her lips a dark purple. The iris of her eyes is grey, her pupil’s pure black. But the outfit she’s wearing is made of pure white, silver stitching at the seams. newlinechar  newlinechar “Want to look up your death?” I asked, not sure what to do. There wasn’t a single report of anyone like me. Someone without the last two minutes of their death recorded on this site. newlinechar  newlinechar “Go ahead,” she said, practically bored. She hadn’t been crazy about the idea of this website in the first place. In fact, I was the one who was fascinated by it. I could see how I would die. How would you not want to do that? newlinechar  newlinechar I pull up the video. Beth is standing on a desolate street, wearing the same clothes as she had on now. In fact, she looked exactly the same now as she did in the video. But weird, burnt out objects sat in the background. Futuristic items. It looked like a sci-fi set had been burned up. newlinechar  newlinechar This went on for a minute. Then Beth smiled, her most beautiful smile. She looked like the happiest person in the world. We watched as I entered the scene, a knife in my hand. I walked over and stabbed her, but all she did was smile, the blood staining her white clothes. newlinechar  newlinechar “What the fuck?” I yelled. newlinechar  newlinechar Beth just looked over at me calmly. newlinechar  newlinechar “I guess we know who won,” she said casually, leaning back in her chair. “I figured since you couldn’t find the video of you and all.” newlinechar  newlinechar “What are you talking about?” I asked, wishing I could scrub the video from my mind. How could I do such a thing? newlinechar  newlinechar “I am Death,” she said melancholily. “That video is a few hundred years in the future. It was you or me. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.” newlinechar  newlinechar “I think we need to get you some medical-” newlinechar  newlinechar I watched as her chair rotted and feel apart. She touched the computer and it sparked and blew up. newlinechar  newlinechar “To think that I, Death, would find love,” she began. “I never would have imagined. I can see the future. I’m the one who created the website. There will come a time where I will be forced to ravage the world with my darkness. The person you know will cease to exist. And we will have an epic fight. In the end you win. And when Death is dead, you can no longer die. You are the one sent to kill me. It is your destiny. For I can’t win. No matter how much a force might possess me, I’ll never be able to let you die.” newlinechar  newlinechar And then Beth stood up and left the house, me sitting there in bewilderment. It all seemed crazy. of course, the existence of a site like that was already crazy enough. Was this such a stretch? newlinechar  newlinechar For a second, I had decided that I would never see Death again. She was just some crazy chick I had loved. But I soon found myself chasing after her, grabbing her arm as she hopped in her car, and dragging her back into my house with me. newlinechar  newlinechar “I won’t kill you,” I said. “I promise.” newlinechar  newlinechar She said nothing, just stroked my cheek. If her love meant that she could not kill me, then I would find away around all of this. I would stop her death. I would stop her decline into madness that she claimed to be her fate. I never believed in fate anyways. newlinechar  newlinechar **** newlinechar  newlinechar The computer puttered on the desk as the couple giggled under the sheets. A video flashed across the screen, only ever so slightly grainy. No sound emanated from the computer. But it showed a picture of the very same scene as the bedroom. Two minutes passed when a loud scream echoed from the room. Nothing came from the computer. But the sheets went flying up and caught on fire. The video turned off on the computer as the woman, stark naked and alone on an empty and undressed bed, sat there and smiled. newlinechar  newlinechar -365

Yeah, I agree.. which is why I found it interesting that HQM was kind of called out as a bad thing in the letter. newlinechar  newlinechar HQM marks the time when pack creators started putting actual thought into the content and purpose of their pack. Prior to that we had things like the FTB Pyramid and a few others. Jaded's packs were always good at following a theme. But user created packs on FTB &amp; ATL were all just 'These mods are fun, I'll put them together, edit a config file or two, name the pack, and release it.' We had 100+ 1.6.4 packs that blended together. The difference in one play through vs another was making a 9-high smeltery this time instead of 6-high. newlinechar  newlinechar HQM helped do exactly what you mention about packs feeling geniuine. Clouds of Darkness, Material Energy, Crash Landing, Agrarian Skies, each one gives the player a purpose and a different gaming experience. There are another half dozen+ I'm not naming and more coming. HQM is up there with NEI in my opinion when it comes to impact on modded minecraft.
&gt; Really most clothing that's not loose and untailored looks immodest to me newlinechar  newlinechar I'm guessing that you're doing fine and that your *perception* is a bit out of whack (and I have to guess, we're on the internet not in person).  That's not a criticism, as you're trying to do the right thing in being modest.  That's a good thing.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I often feel like I have the wrong sort of body for modesty newlinechar  newlinechar Nope.  You have your body, given to you by God.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I feel like a lot of guys see a large-chested woman, they see her as immodest newlinechar  newlinechar That's on them, *not you*.  That is 100% out of your control and 100% not your responsibility.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Brothers and sisters, what am I missing? newlinechar  newlinechar Perspective, probably.  Do you have any Catholic women that you can talk to in person about this issue?  Perhaps talking to your priest would also help. newlinechar  newlinechar --------------------- newlinechar  newlinechar You can also look into classic clothing.  Those outfit basics that don't go out of style.  Right now if I were a woman I'd probably not be seen outside without a cable knit sweater and jeans (we guys have it so much easier in this area).  100% coverage, 100% comfy.  Button up blouses go pretty much year round.  So do slacks.  Swap out your accessories and you can somewhat keep up with fashion so you don't look 'young' or dated. newlinechar  newlinechar There are cool places out there (Edit: PM for a specific recommendation, didn't think about the rules for a sec) that not only offer some cool current and retro dresses and separates, but they also tailor it to your dimensions for a reasonable fee.  My wife loves these dresses--modest and cute as well as retro.  She has ordered me to tell you that you should never pay full price on such sites, as there are always coupons.   newlinechar  newlinechar Basically, in my opinion if you're trying you're probably doing fine.  I would highly suggest talking to someone you know if you have anyone you'd trust.

&gt;In the US you can buy just about anything if you have the money. There is no inequality here unless you are whining about the cost of things ... if that is the case then you are being silly newlinechar  newlinechar Then go buy a house on minimum wage. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;We are not a colony or a hive, we are a collection individuals pursuing our own separate interests and this process is how we became the top species on the planet and have sent ourselves and ships to the planets newlinechar  newlinechar A collection of individuals that rely upon one another for everyday survival.  The tools we use, the food we eat, and the medicine we have that treats our illnesses are a benefit of our being a social species. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Government as an institution is immoral because it relies on violence to get things done. We as a species need to take a long look and make the moral determination that government is no longer necessary newlinechar  newlinechar Completely agree newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The vast amount and variety of goods and services available shows there is no problem with the means of production newlinechar  newlinechar The fact that scientitst predict an end to humanity caused by global warming shows short-sightedness on the part of those who continue damaging the environment in pursuit of short term profit.  If you don't believe in global warming or whatever, consider the invasion of Iraq in pursuit of oil.  The short sightedness that led to the invasion has caused immense damage to the middle east. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Education is failing because government is involved in it .. as for profit , education is a service which means people have to be paid to perform this service which means there is competition which means there needs to be profit. Profit is not a problem .. profit is the means where new wealth and jobs are created newlinechar  newlinechar Education should be a right, not a privalege.  A quality education should be afforded to every child, not just those with money.  Our government intervening and turning learning institutions into social conditioning factories is part of the problem as is the groups who seek to control education as a means of social advancement. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That is because healthcare is a service not a right and services are run by businesses which need to profit for them to be able to continue providing that service. Nothinfg is free except the rights we can exercise newlinechar  newlinechar If you believe healthcare is a privilege, then you believe life is a privilege.  Medicine was not invented to keep only those who could afford it healthy, it was invented to keep people alive. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Just turn off the TV, its in your power to do this. newlinechar  newlinechar I believe that, in the future, people will think like this.  They will say 'Why didn't they just turn the damn TV off and do something about it?'    It's easy to think like that when you aren't under the subtle control of this device. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That is because healthcare is a service not a right and services are run by businesses which need to profit for them to be able to continue providing that service. Nothinfg is free except the rights we can exercise newlinechar  newlinechar As life is necessary for survival, wouldn't it be better to socialize this cost?  As everyone needs to live, wouldn't everyone have the same amount of vested interest in survival?  The simple fact of the matter is, making health insurance privatized has made it incredibly inefficient and expensive.  The only people who benefit from an incredibly expensive health care system are those with a lot of wealth and those who run the system of what is essentially extortion. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;the amount given to charities globally debunks this cynical opinion ... newlinechar  newlinechar 72% of people supported the invasion of Iraq in 2003.  A large portion of the goods consumed in the U.S. are produced by what is effectively slave labor.  And the amount given to charities to do what?  1 in 45 children experience homelessness in the U.S. each year.  No, blindly throwing money at the problem to make your guilt go away can hardly be considered interest in the well-being of your fellow man. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Your pursuit for a utopia is infantile and unattainable. Man is imperfect, he will always be imperfect as so the world we live in will be imperfect as well. Grow-up and deal with it. How you deal with it is how one becomes and adult newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not in pursuit of a utopia, I just want to improve the system we have now.  Discarding dated imperialistic ideologies, keeping beneficial technologies, and improving the wellbeing of everyone as opposed to only helping a small group.  My goal is entirely attainable, it will just take vast societal changes.   newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Grow-up and deal with it. How you deal with it is how one becomes and adult newlinechar  newlinechar I'm looking for ways to better society as a whole, and you view this idea as childish?  You think that simply biting the bullet and putting up with a corrupt and exploitative system is an adult thing to do?

Torches and Supermodel is so vastly different.  newlinechar  newlinechar I recommend checking out Torches first, although you will most likely not like Supermodel as much as Torches. Torches starts off amazingly with Helena Beat, that song alone basically having me buy the album. THing about Supermodel is that Tabloid Super Junkie was a pre-order exclusive, and that song really adds to how good of an album it is. Ending with Fire Escape is just.. not right imo. newlinechar  newlinechar I listened to Supermodel and then Torches, and I love both albums, so really it's up to you. But you gotta listen to both of them

If their previous work is indicative of a pattern, it will look very similar externally with similar end-user characteristics, but be a fairly original design.

If he did 'fake' it, how do you expect he did it? All of the proof is there to believe this is actually real. His inventory is the same from the previous video, his beard and hair is obviously longer than any other video, he uses his knife that Nova got him for Christmas (has to be after Christmas), he has all of those cases still left over in his inventory, he clearly shows his mouse going over the item in his inventory (which if he faked it would be really hard to manipulate the mouse going over the item), he played with the knife in a game with his account, and prior to this video his steam inventory was public and there was no knife in his inventory.

Well, to be honest, I feel like by opting out of child support, but by getting to see the child, he's getting all of the benefits (watching kid grow up, offer friendly advice, hang out), along with none of the responsibility (cost, sacrifice of time [when he doesn't want to]/energy, being the bad guy about keeping the kid out of trouble, etc).  newlinechar  newlinechar It's hard for me to explain, and understand, myself... Because I feel like if I did adopt a child, I wouldn't mind the bio-parents stopping by every once in awhile.  newlinechar  newlinechar I guess it's kinda like the difference of how you know someone. The scenario between these two, at least in my head, is:  newlinechar  newlinechar - I'm dating a guy for awhile, I accidentally get pregnant, for some reason I decide not to have an abortion, and he is like 'Sorry, even though I said I love you before, we can't do this together. You're on your own, I'm outta here! This is the best choice for me.' newlinechar  newlinechar - With adoption, both bio-parents are saying 'We can't do this together.

You're absolutely right, friend. The entire industry is mainly a scam that the couch potato crowd pays in to. Like you said I'm going to get shit for this but when you go on deployment or tdy, or even stateside sometimes, as soon as someone decides they want to get fit, the supplement shop is the first place they stop after one week at the gym and no washboard abs yet. 90+% is just some filler bs 'proprietary blend' and the other ingredients are common stuff you could get naturally elsewhere, like caffeine for pre workouts. In CCT, PJ, TACP, etc training you're not even allowed to take supplements, and that's when I learned it's best to train naturally anyways. Not to sound overly cliche but I'm going to, If you get in a firefight, is the enemy going to wait for you to take jacked do you're ready to rock and roll, or is it most likely going to cine in the middle of the night when you're sleeping and unprepared? Maybe if I remember I take protein after a workout but that's it. A healthy diet is the biggest factor to your health. Sorry fot the rant but if I saved one person from having a heart attack at the gym their first week into deployment from taking hydroxycut, then I reckon it was worth it.

What I've noticed throughout this thread is that you're defending your position instead of actually considering what everyone is telling you. newlinechar  newlinechar For example, Woodson was a 3-time All Pro.

On and on. newlinechar  newlinechar That defense was the best defense in the league. That defense was good because its players were good. newlinechar  newlinechar You can argue it with everyone who's trying to tell you otherwise, but it doesn't change the fact that, as of now, this team is nowhere near as good as that one.  The 90s Cowboys were one of the most dominant groups in NFL history. newlinechar  newlinechar Unlike you, I remember it clearly.  This defense is not like that defense at all.  And this team isn't either.  Not yet. newlinechar  newlinechar You can disagree all you want.  But if you're going to post here and try to compare the teams, you'll be doing yourself a favor if you do it with an open mind.  Because subbies who *do* remember are trying to educate you.

Ehhhh. A little bit of the manifesto and what other commies have rehashed to me. It has helped with understanding economics a little better, but that just made me lean towards syndicalism. Sure capitalism allows for people to get lucky and never have to do anything productive for the rest of their lives, but socialism has this miserable taboo that is so embedded in some cultures we may as well give up trying to preach it. Syndicates have been shown to work the most effectively for the most people in real life. But there's still thus competitive atmosphere that I see is necessary, but it's not exactly morally fulfilling. I think it's more a problem with people thah politics.

I've said this before on reddit, but I just don't think abortion is the solution. It's a symptom of a broken system. Poor sex education and poor access to contraceptives cause teen pregnancy, which is still extremely taboo. Fear of judgement and being ostracized prevents young girls from seeking out wise counsel and being able to consider all the options. I feel like our current culture not only could do better in preventing unwanted pregnancy, but it also drives people to what is, in my opinion, an extreme measure (abortion).  newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think anyone LIKES abortion. No one is out in the streets saying 'abortion is great!' No one wants to kill a fetus, that's why it's such a tough decision to make.

Probably a gas furnace.  The rental I own has one furnace for two apartments.  I have to pay the gas bill as it can't be split legally. My tenants have their own electric meters and as soon as we can afford to, we will add electric baseboard heat.  It isn't as good or efficient, but the tenants take advantage of us paying the bill and crank their heat, open doors, windows etc.  The usage is much higher than when we lived there.  I'm a reluctant landlord stuck with my starter house because no one wants to buy it.  I don't want to change the heat, but when the tenants don't pay the heat bill they don't seem to care how much they use and it's food off the table for my kids.

Hundreds of thousands of people have bought these 'consumer driven health plans' and have not saved the money they saved, and even when they do, its not enough. newlinechar  newlinechar You cant afford concierge medicine.

(cognitive dissonance theory) They deny reality. newlinechar  newlinechar Huge numbers of people do what you're doing and find its not enough when they get sick. The chronically ill cannot afford all this cost shifting. They get hit with thousands of dollars in bills when they thought they were insured and they cannot afford to pay them and soon they are in debt for huge huge sums.  newlinechar  newlinechar According to every knowledgeable source these high deductible health pans should be banned, and thats how Obamacare was sold, but they didn't ban them, now they are promoting them.

You know how lawyers say that that never ask a question they don't already know the answer to?  newlinechar  newlinechar Apply that here.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm from Mexico. I was born in Guadalajara.  newlinechar  newlinechar I left home at 14.  newlinechar  newlinechar I was homeless for three years before becoming pregnant.  newlinechar  newlinechar I was a single Mom and waitress from 17-21.  newlinechar  newlinechar At 21 I became a bartender.  newlinechar  newlinechar At 22 I realized I needed to figure my shit out.  newlinechar  newlinechar At 23 I bought my first share of real estate. On a bartender's wage. While raising my child.  newlinechar  newlinechar At 31 I bought my first house.  newlinechar  newlinechar At 34 I bought my second.  newlinechar  newlinechar At 36 I bought my third.  newlinechar  newlinechar At 37 I will buy my fourth.  newlinechar  newlinechar At 38th I will buy my fifth.  newlinechar  newlinechar At 39 I will be making enough income from my investments to live where I want to live and, essentially, retire. But don't worry, I'll have a thousand side hustles going on - I wouldn't know what to do if I wasn't trying to make *some* sort of money.  newlinechar  newlinechar You still as angry as you were at my working hard and trying to make something of my life?  newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT:  newlinechar  newlinechar Oh, and one more thing: My Father WAS a physician. I'm sure he made money, but I wouldn't know, as we weren't raised as you would think a doctor's kid would have been raised. My parents were very strict and very religious, and raised us to work for everything we had. We didn't have television. We weren't allowed to listen to music. We weren't allowed to have friends over or stay at others' houses. And, unless we were actually bleeding out of our eyeballs, we didn't get medical care, either. The cobbler's son has no shoes, and all that jazz. newlinechar And when I started to rebel in my early teen years, I was cut off from having any sort of contact with the family at all. The worst part was not getting to see my sisters, as I'm the oldest, and had always been their protector. I remember one time trying to come see my youngest sister (she was three at the time), and my family locked all the doors and turned on the alarm system to the house. My little sister, likely seeing how malnourished I was (I went days without food back then), put an apple up to the window for me. I couldn't open the door to get it, but her little-girl way of showing me kindness made me cry. It still makes me cry. It's the little things. newlinechar So I guess you can say I was privileged in the fact that my family was probably doing okay financially, but that didn't trickle down beyond normal roof over the head and clothing on the body. newlinechar I will say that the best piece of advice my Father ever gave me was, 'Always buy dinner for the guy who makes the most money at the table, because he/she's the one who feels obligated to buy for everyone else.' newlinechar I've used those words of wisdom in every aspect of my life. Entitlement is a fucking epidemic, man, and it NEVER pays the bills.
I dont mean to sound disrespectful eventhough there is no easier way to put it but, itd be too awkward for me to stay at home and then have to ask for money for every single thing, like what does your life consist of? Parenting being a full time job is not an 'excuse'
For adults, it's not as easy. At least in my state, you have to be evaluated by a mental health professional. If they deem you a threat to yourself or others, they can request a court order for involuntary commitment of 72 hours. The request is basically a formality, I've never seen a judge reject a request from them. newlinechar  newlinechar With minors, the parent/guardian has full legal custody and can 'voluntarily' place their child in a psychiatric facility. At least from what I've seen, that still requires a mental health professional to evaluate the minor and agree to it. I've seen a couple occasions where the MHP refused to do the commitment, because they felt the child was not a threat, but most of the time it winds up with the kid going to a psych facility.

Intro here then!
If a neighborhood is unattractive enough, wealthier people won't move into it. Given the choice, people will not move into an area of urban decay. This is the alternative to gentrification. I didn't say it was a *good* alternative. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think it is right for a neighborhood to try to keep out people because the outsiders are 'different.' When my parents were shopping for a house in Los Angeles in the 1960s, they were not allowed to buy a house some neighborhoods because they weren't caucasian. I'm sure the people living in those neighborhoods just thought they were protecting the character of the area. But it was wrong then, and it's still wrong.

In this case, he is acting on his desires by finding and storing pictures of underage girls to whack it to.

He's got pictures of *five-year-olds* for crying out loud, they're not choosing to dress up and take pictures of themselves and upload them online. Someone's sexualizing them and taking advantage of them, and he's contributing to the problem by being part of the demand.

If it's a smaller program, this naturally happens. The people in my program  are somewhat close because we are in every class together and even work together for our research assistantships. Part-time people kinda group to themselves, because they're in the same boat. Honestly, they just don't know you and maybe you should try to break down the barriers if you want to get to know them.  newlinechar  newlinechar Start slow by asking about a paper or topic that was discussed in class. If it's someone you've had classes with before, strike up conversation about some aspect of it you've liked/disliked/found interesting. I've also always found that simply saying hello to someone when you see them can make them warm up to you. After getting to know some people a bit better ask about creating a study group, possibly over some drinks (if you drink) or food. I know it sucks to put in the effort to make friends if you're shy. But it really helps!

if it wasn't for mcfc you wouldn't have a club though? City are one of the best teams in football on the planet and you don't care about your team being owned by city? Through their resources you landed David villa and will land other big names as well as eds players so if you want to support a new york city club then go ahead but one player doesn't make the club. newlinechar  newlinechar I think if it was any other city besides new york the reaction would not be as blown out of proportion. Any city in America would be grateful for a team owned by a world class side to create them a local team, sign them world class players, loan them eds players, and develop local kids into potential world class players.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also mls never had a say because once frank signed for nycfc he signed to mcfc as a free agent on a short term contract, so he was always a city player.

&gt; I don't think we ever tell other girls they 'hug like a boy' or 'sew like a boy' or 'cook like a boy' and mean it as an insult. newlinechar &gt; By the way, 'you throw like a girl' is an insult -- ask any third-grader. It's an insult, and it's abso-fucking-lutely meant to be one. So is 'you cry like a girl,' 'you run like a girl,' 'you dance like a girl,' and any of its corollaries.   newlinechar  newlinechar I never said it wasn't an insult - it definitely is. I just don't think it's necessarily saying that women are somehow lesser. It's not *being a woman* that they are saying is bad, it's *not being a man*. At least, that's my take on that saying - I may very well be completely wrong.   newlinechar  newlinechar As for the 'you hug like a boy' thing, I have definitely been told things like that. If I ever struggle with my emotions or children or cooking or some other traditionally feminine subject, I will inevitably get 'you're such a man.' It's a phrase I'd love to hear if I were picking up something heavy or breaking a tree in half with my manly pecs, but in that context it's definitely patronising.   newlinechar  newlinechar I guess what I'm really trying to say over all these comments is that gender roles suck, but there they are.

Out of complete curiosity I did some googling to see if there ever had been strikes by teachers over anything similar. I think part of the reason we have not seen strikes of this nature is because [it looks like it is still legal in 19 states.](http://www.businessinsider.com/19-states-still-allow-corporal-punishment-2014-3) Specifically in these states it is allowed to strike a student (paddles are pretty common) as a means of discipline, though I am unsure of any stipulations required in such an instance.

No sane person I know relies on bloodwork entirely for their health picture, it's just a component.

Think about it though. You have 15 or 16 slots, and assuming you have an epic in each slot that's 15 or 16 temporal crystals. newlinechar  newlinechar You also have 4 enchants that cost 4 crystals each, so right there that's your 16 crystals from DEing every piece of gear you replaced (assuming a whole new set). On top of that you have weapon enchants, which adds 3 crystals for tanks/heals, then 15 for most DPS classes (30 for dual wielders). This *is* ingoring your daily CD/workorders, but enchants this expack are so expensive that I don't think the price will crash much once BRF gets released.

Hey /u/neon_prayers. The selfishness verging on narcissism that characterizes being a drunk like me doesn't go away when the alcohol goes away, I found out.

I have mostly the same sentiments, but I can't say that I wouldn't take dietetics again. My education helps me sift through all the bs that we're inundated by especially pertaining to the health and medical sectors. While this doesn't necessarily help you get a really good paying job, I've found that it helps me stay a little more balanced with my life. newlinechar I knew someone that was a CS major who went straight into an accelerated graduate design program. He asked me if eating too much fruit was going to give him diabetes. The truth is I don't really know. But I told him that if his worries revolve around eating too much fruit, he's probably doing okay. It's nice that I'm not asking myself those questions.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'd say a nutrition bachelor's degree without the internship probably has the same amount of value as a biology degree. So, more than a liberal arts degree but not by much. newlinechar Don't pick dietetics if money is really important to you.

You are in China.  newlinechar  newlinechar You are absolutely right in the sense that I shouldn't jump to judgement on that girl. She might be just not into OP and/or she just like a certain type of culture of the west.

Every year at the county fair a hypnotist comes and puts on a few shows.  He would ask 15-20 people from the audience to come up to the stage and do similar acts as the video above, making people dance, hot/cold, sing, etc.  It didn't work on everyone so a few people usually are asked to leave the stage.  One time my buddy Brandon volunteered and was in the show.  Now Brandon is one of the most quiet and reserved guys you'll ever meet, but when he was on stage hypnotized he was hilarious!  Dancing, singing, hugging random other people, just crazy stuff.  When he was un-hypnotized he could barely remember doing anything, even when he watched a recording of the show.  He swears it worked and knowing how reserved he usually is, I believe him.   newlinechar  newlinechar So long story short, though that looks fake and cringey, I'd believe they're hypnotized.

That's because addiction is a medical problem that is treated like a criminal one to everyone except the wealthy. And the reason for that is because of profits from the illegal drug trades to police department search and seizures to the for-profit prison systems. The 'crackhead' (or other heavy drug addict) is only a symptom of a bigger problem that has been ballooning up since the 80's in America, and that is the school to prison pipeline coupled with the harsh drug sentencing that was imposed by Reagan. newlinechar  newlinechar Anyone who has legitimately recovered has only hit rock bottom because there are few support systems to help poor addicts recover before then. Clinics are there to help rich clientele to get clean, but not the ones who cannot foot the bill. While it is true that a person can 'change from within', the chemical imbalances caused by drug dependency can literally KILL some addicts depending on the drug, and the cravings will drive them to re-abuse until they finally overdose. newlinechar  newlinechar The medical system could easily be tailored to change the punitive nature of drug abuse to a medical illness type of rehabilitation, but all that sweet money from housing non-violent drug offenders who will repeat offend until they become lifers is too damn good to pass up. With all the medical staff looking for a steady job in America, hiring them to detox drug addicts who have been sentenced to a clinic for rehabilitation would not only stimulate the job market in the medical, construction and mental health industries, but it would also contribute to the number of able-bodied people in the workforce. In fact, with time and training, addicts could become counselors to other addicts. newlinechar  newlinechar It's a wasted opportunity.
